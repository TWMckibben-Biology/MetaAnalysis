AB  - Hormones are largely responsible for the integrated communication of several physiological systems responsible for modulating cellular growth and development.  Although the specific hormonal influence must be considered within the context of  the entire endocrine system and its relationship with other physiological  systems, three key hormones are considered the "anabolic giants" in cellular  growth and repair: testosterone, the growth hormone superfamily, and the  insulin-like growth factor (IGF) superfamily. In addition to these anabolic  hormones, glucocorticoids, mainly cortisol must also be considered because of  their profound opposing influence on human skeletal muscle anabolism in many  instances. This review presents emerging research on: (1) Testosterone signaling  pathways, responses, and adaptations to resistance training; (2) Growth hormone:  presents new complexity with exercise stress; (3) Current perspectives on IGF-I  and physiological adaptations and complexity these hormones as related to  training; and (4) Glucocorticoid roles in integrated communication for  anabolic/catabolic signaling. Specifically, the review describes (1) Testosterone  as the primary anabolic hormone, with an anabolic influence largely dictated  primarily by genomic and possible non-genomic signaling, satellite cell  activation, interaction with other anabolic signaling pathways, upregulation or  downregulation of the androgen receptor, and potential roles in co-activators and  transcriptional activity; (2) Differential influences of growth hormones  depending on the "type" of the hormone being assayed and the magnitude of the  physiological stress; (3) The exquisite regulation of IGF-1 by a family of  binding proteins (IGFBPs 1-6), which can either stimulate or inhibit biological  action depending on binding; and (4) Circadian patterning and newly discovered  variants of glucocorticoid isoforms largely dictating glucocorticoid sensitivity  and catabolic, muscle sparing, or pathological influence. The downstream  integrated anabolic and catabolic mechanisms of these hormones not only affect  the ability of skeletal muscle to generate force; they also have implications for  pharmaceutical treatments, aging, and prevalent chronic conditions such as  metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and hypertension. Thus, advances in our  understanding of hormones that impact anabolic: catabolic processes have  relevance for athletes and the general population, alike.

AB  - Cellular and molecular aging biomarkers might contribute to identify at-risk individuals for frailty before overt clinical manifestations appear. Although  studies on the associations of aging biomarkers and frailty exist, no  investigation has gathered this information using a structured framework for  identifying aging biomarkers; as a result, the evidence on frailty and aging  biomarkers is diffuse and incomplete. Therefore, this narrative review aimed to  gather information on the associations of the hallmarks of aging and frailty  under the perspective of geroscience. The literature on human studies on this  topic is sparse and mainly composed of cross-sectional investigations performed  in small study samples. The main putative aging biomarkers associated to frailty  were: mitochondrial DNA copy number (genomic instability and mitochondrial  dysfunction), telomere length (telomere attrition), global DNA methylation  (epigenetic alterations), Hsp70 and Hsp72 (loss of proteostasis), IGF-1 and SIRT1  (deregulated nutrient-sensing), GDF-15 (mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular  senescence and altered intercellular communication), CD4 + and CD8 + cell  percentages (cellular senescence), circulating osteogenic progenitor (COP) cells  (stem cell exhaustion), and IL-6, CRP and TNF-alpha (altered intercellular  communication). IGF-1, SIRT1, GDF-15, IL-6, CRP and TNF-alpha presented more  evidence among these biomarkers, highlighting the importance of inflammation and  nutrient sensing on frailty. Further longitudinal studies investigating  biomarkers across the hallmarks of aging would provide valuable information on  this topic.

AB  - Growth hormone (GH) is a peptide hormone that can signal directly through its receptor or indirectly through insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) stimulation.  GH draws its name from its anabolic effects on muscle and bone but also has  distinct metabolic effects in multiple tissues. In addition to its metabolic and  musculoskeletal effects, GH is closely associated with aging, with levels  declining as individuals age but GH action negatively correlating with lifespan.  GH's effects have been studied in human conditions of GH alteration, such as  acromegaly and Laron syndrome, and GH therapies have been suggested to combat  aging-related musculoskeletal diseases, in part, because of the decline in GH  levels with advanced age. While clinical data are inconclusive, animal models  have been indispensable in understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms of  GH action. This review will provide a brief overview of the musculoskeletal  effects of GH, focusing on clinical and animal models.

AB  - Human aging is currently defined as a physiological decline of biological functions in the body with a continual adaptation to internal and external  damaging. The endocrine system plays a major role in orchestrating cellular  interactions, metabolism, growth, and aging. Several in vivo studies from worms  to mice showed that downregulated activity of the GH/IGF-1/insulin pathway could  be beneficial for the extension of human life span, whereas results are  contradictory in humans. In the present review, we discuss the potential role of  the IGF-1 system in modulation of longevity, hypothesizing that the endocrine and  metabolic adaptation observed in centenarians and in mammals during caloric  restriction may be a physiological strategy for extending lifespan through a  slower cell growing/metabolism, a better physiologic reserve capacity, a shift of  cellular metabolism from cell proliferation to repair activities and a decrease  in accumulation of senescent cells. Therefore, understanding of the link between  IGF-1/insulin system and longevity may have future clinical applications in  promoting healthy aging and in Rehabilitation Medicine.

AB  - Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is a peptide hormone belonging to the insulin family of proteins. Almost all of the biological effects of IGF-1 are  mediated through binding to its high-affinity tyrosine kinase receptor (IGF1R), a  transmembrane receptor belonging to the insulin receptor family. Factors,  receptors and IGF-binding proteins form the IGF system, which has multiple roles  in mammalian development, adult tissue homeostasis, and aging. Consequently,  mutations in genes of the IGF system, including downstream intracellular targets,  underlie multiple common pathologies and are associated with multiple rare human  diseases. Here we review the contribution of the IGF system to our understanding  of the molecular and genetic basis of human hearing loss by describing, (i) the  expression patterns of the IGF system in the mammalian inner ear; (ii) downstream  signaling of IGF-1 in the hearing organ; (iii) mouse mutations in the IGF system,  including upstream regulators and downstream targets of IGF-1 that inform  cochlear pathophysiology; and (iv) human mutations in these genes causing hearing  loss.

AB  - Recent studies have shown that insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 signaling are involved in the control of ageing and longevity in model organisms.  Based on these studies, genes involved in the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway are  believed to play a role in longevity throughout evolution and could also be  important in determining human longevity. However, human studies have yielded  conflicting and controversial results. In human, defects in insulin receptor  signaling cause insulin resistance and diabetes, and IGF-1 deficiency is  associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis.  Interestingly, insulin sensitivity normally decreases during aging; however,  centenarians were reported to maintain greatly increased insulin sensitivity and  had a lower prevalence of the metabolic syndrome as compared to younger subjects.  Additionally, a longitudinal study revealed that insulin-sensitizing hormones,  including leptin and adiponectin, were significantly associated with the survival  of centenarians, indicating that an efficient insulin response may influence  human longevity.

AB  - Mutations resulting in reduced signaling of the growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor-1 (GH/IGF-1) axis are associated with increased life- and  healthspan across model organisms. Similar findings have been noted in human  cohorts with functional mutations in the somatotropic axis, suggesting that this  pathway may also be relevant to human aging and protection from age-related  diseases. While epidemiological data indicate that low circulating IGF-1 level  may protect aging populations from cancer, results remain inconclusive regarding  most other diseases. We propose that studies in humans and animals need to  consider differences in sex, pathway function, organs, and time-specific effects  of GH/IGF-1 signaling in order to better define the role of the somatotropic axis  in aging. Agents that modulate signaling of the GH/IGF-1 pathway are available  for human use, but before they can be implemented in clinical studies that target  aging and age-related diseases, researchers need to address the challenges  discussed in this Review.

AU  - Bartke, Andrzej
AU  - Darcy, Justin
T2  - Best practice & research. Clinical endocrinology & metabolism
AB  - The interrelationships of growth hormone (GH) actions and aging are complex and incompletely understood. The very pronounced age-related decline in GH secretion  together with benefits of GH therapy in individuals with congenital or adult GH  deficiency (GHD) prompted interest in GH as an anti-aging agent. However, the  benefits of treatment of normal elderly subjects with GH appear to be marginal  and counterbalanced by worrisome side effects. In laboratory mice, genetic GH  deficiency or resistance leads to a remarkable extension of longevity accompanied  by signs of delayed and/or slower aging. Mechanisms believed to contribute to  extended longevity of GH-related mutants include improved anti-oxidant defenses,  enhanced insulin sensitivity and reduced insulin levels, reduced inflammation and  cell senescence, major shifts in mitochondrial function and energy metabolism,  and greater stress resistance. Negative association of the somatotropic signaling  and GH/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1)-dependent traits with longevity has  also been shown in other mammalian species. In humans, syndromes of GH resistance  or deficiency have no consistent effect on longevity, but can provide striking  protection from cancer, diabetes and atherosclerosis. More subtle alterations in  various steps of GH and IGF-1 signaling are associated with reduced old-age  mortality, particularly in women and with improved chances of attaining extremes  of lifespan. Epidemiological studies raise a possibility that the relationship of  IGF-1 and perhaps also GH levels with human healthy aging and longevity may be  biphasic. However, the impact of somatotropic signaling on neoplastic disease is  difficult to separate from its impact on aging, and IGF-1 levels exhibit opposite  associations with different chronic, age-related diseases.

AB  - Reduced somatotropic [growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)] action has been associated with delayed and slower aging, reduced risk  of frailty, reduced age-related disease and functional decline, and with  remarkably extended longevity. Recent studies have added to the evidence that  these relationships discovered in laboratory populations of mice apply to other  mammalian species. However, the relationship of the somatotropic signaling to  human aging is less striking, complex and controversial. In mice, targeted  deletion of GH receptors (GHR) in the liver, muscle or adipose tissue affected  multiple metabolic parameters but failed to reproduce the effects of global GHR  deletion on longevity. Continued search for mechanisms of extended longevity in  animals with GH deficiency or resistance focused attention on different pathways  of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), energy metabolism, regulation of local  IGF-1 levels and resistance to high-fat diet (HFD).

In human and non-human  primates, CR has beneficial effects on human longevity and reduces the incidence  of age-related diseases such as obesity, diabetes mellitus hypertension,  cardiovascular disease and cancer. CR exerts its anti-aging effects through  different mechanisms including small noncoding RNA molecules (sncRNAs), the  composition of diet and IGF-1 signaling. The aim of this review was to discuss  recent developments to understand the consequences and mechanisms of CR on  longevity.

TI  - Birth weight predicts aging trajectory: A hypothesis.
AU  - Vaiserman, Alexander M.
T2  - Mechanisms of ageing and development
AB  - Increasing evidence suggests that risk for age-related disease and longevity can be programmed early in life. In human populations, convincing evidence has been  accumulated indicating that intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) resulting in  low birth weight (<2.5 kg) followed by postnatal catch-up growth is associated  with various aspects of metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular  disease in adulthood. Fetal macrosomia (birth weight > 4.5 kg), by contrast, is  associated with high risk of non-diabetic obesity and cancers in later life.  Developmental modification of epigenetic patterns is considered to be a central  mechanism in determining such developmentally programmed phenotypes. Growth  hormone/insulin-like growth factor (GH/IGF) axis is likely a key driver of these  processes. In this review, evidence is discussed that suggests that different  aging trajectories can be realized depending on developmentally programmed  life-course dynamics of IGF-1. In this hypothetical scenario, IUGR-induced  deficit of IGF-1 causes "diabetic" aging trajectory associated with various  metabolic disorders in adulthood, while fetal macrosomia-induced excessive levels  of IGF-1 lead to "cancerous" aging trajectory. If the above reasoning is correct,  then both low and high birth weights are predictors of short life expectancy,  while the normal birth weight is a predictor of "normal" aging and maximum  longevity.

AB  - An organism's well-being is facilitated by numerous molecular and biochemical pathways that ensure homeostasis within cells and tissues. Aging causes a gradual  let-down in the maintenance of homeostasis due to various endogenous and  environmental challenges, leading to amassing of damages, functional  deterioration of different tissues and vulnerability to ailments. Nutrient  sensing pathways that maintain glucose homeostasis in body are involved in  regulation of aging. Insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signalling  (IIS) pathway was the first nutrient sensing pathway discovered to affect the  aging process. This pathway is highly conserved and the most studied among  different organisms. Epigenetic machineries that include DNA and histone  modifying enzymes and various non-coding RNAs have been identified as important  contributors to nutrition-related longevity and aging control. In this report, we  present the homology and differences in IIS pathway of various organisms  including worm, fly, rodent and human. We also discuss how epigenome remodelling,  chromatin based strategies, small and long non-coding RNA are involved to  regulate multiple steps of aging or age-related insulin homeostasis. Enhanced  study of the role of IIS pathway and epigenetic mechanisms that regulate aging  may facilitate progressive prevention and treatment of human age-related  diseases.

AB  - The fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) and Klotho system play a very important role in the regulation of the human body metabolism. On the one hand, they  promote longevity, and on the other hand they promote insulin resistance.  Nowadays, accelerated aging in diabetes as the main consequence of chronic  complications of the disease is postulated. Signalling pathways induced by  insulin, insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), and their homologues play an  important role in controlling the aging process. Because FGF23/Klotho system  affects glucose metabolism and gene expression of antioxidant enzymes, changes in  its concentration may be a marker of chronic complications of diabetes or a  treatment option. Despite huge improvements in the treatment of diabetes, its  chronic complications remain an important clinical problem. An interesting issue  is the relationship between the concentration of FGF23/Klotho and management of  the disease, duration, insulin resistance, and development of complications in  type 1 diabetes.

AB  - The diabetes and osteoporotic metabolic diseases are characterized by a wide prevalence of the population worldwide and correlated to alteration of the bone  tissues. Several cofactors could influence the clinical course and the  biochemistry of the pathologies such as human microbiome, nutrition  characteristics, gut microbiota activity and interactions with vitamin K and D  across IGF/GH and TP53 signaling pathways and the glucose/energy as mechanism for  bone tissue health. Moreover, also the calories and sugar consumption seem to be  correlated to an increased inflammatory state with several consequences for  hematopoiesis and host tissues response. The aim of the present literature review  was to highlight the role of osteoporotic diseases and diabetes type 2 link for  the bone metabolism. The literature cases showed that a correlation between  bone-gut-kidney-heart-CNS-Immunity crosstalk seems to be linked with bone  metabolism and health regulation. Moreover, also the aging process could  represent a valuable co-factor for the sustaining of the metabolic disorders upon  a multi-systemic level.

AB  - Health span is driven by a precise interplay between genes and the environment. Cell response to environmental cues is mediated by signaling cascades and genetic  variants that affect gene expression by regulating chromatin plasticity. Indeed,  they can promote the interaction of promoters with regulatory elements by forming  active chromatin hubs. FOXO3 encodes a transcription factor with a strong impact  on aging and age-related phenotypes, as it regulates stress response, therefore  affecting lifespan. A significant association has been shown between human  longevity and several FOXO3 variants located in intron 2. This haplotype block  forms a putative aging chromatin hub in which FOXO3 has a central role, as it  modulates the physical connection and activity of neighboring genes involved in  age-related processes. Here we describe the role of FOXO3 and its  single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in healthy aging, with a focus on the  enhancer region encompassing the SNP rs2802292, which upregulates FOXO3  expression and can promote the activity of the aging hub in response to different  stress stimuli. FOXO3 protective effect on lifespan may be due to the  accessibility of this region to transcription factors promoting its expression.  This could in part explain the differences in FOXO3 association with longevity  between genders, as its activity in females may be modulated by estrogens through  estrogen receptor response elements located in the rs2802292-encompassing region.  Altogether, the molecular mechanisms described here may help establish whether  the rs2802292 SNP can be taken advantage of in predictive medicine and define the  potential of targeting FOXO3 for age-related diseases.

TI  - Growth hormone, insulin and aging: the benefits of endocrine defects.
AU  - Bartke, Andrzej
T2  - Experimental gerontology
AB  - Longevity of mice can be increased by spontaneous or experimentally induced mutations that interfere with the biosynthesis or actions of growth hormone (GH),  insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), or insulin in the adipose tissue. The  effects of GH resistance and deficiency of GH (along with thyrotropin and  prolactin) on aging and lifespan are the most pronounced and best established of  these mutations. Potential mechanisms linking these endocrine deficits with  delayed aging and extended longevity include increased stress resistance,  alterations in insulin and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling and  metabolic adjustments. Physiological relationships deduced from the extreme  phenotypes of long-lived mouse mutants appear to apply broadly, encompassing  genetically normal ("wild-type") mice and other mammalian species. The role of GH  in the control of human aging continues to be hotly debated, but recent data  indicate that reduced somatotropic signaling provides protection from cancer and  other age-related diseases and may promote old age survival.

TI  - Sex Differences in Longevity and in Responses to Anti-Aging Interventions: A Mini-Review.
AU  - Austad, Steven N.

AB  - A robust, often underappreciated, feature of human biology is that women live longer than men not just in technologically advanced, low-mortality countries  such as those in Europe or North America, but across low- and high-mortality  countries of the modern world as well as through history. Women's survival  advantage is not due to protection from one or a few diseases. Women die at lower  rates than men from virtually all the top causes of death with the notable  exception of Alzheimer's disease, to which women are particularly prone. Yet,  despite this robust survival advantage, women across countries of the world  suffer worse health throughout life. The biological mechanisms underlying either  longer female survival or poorer female health remain elusive and understudied.  Mechanisms of mammalian biology, particularly with respect to aging and disease,  are most easily studied in laboratory mice. Although there are no consistent  differences in longevity between mouse sexes even within single genotypes, there  are often substantial differences in individual studies, sometimes favoring  females, other times males. Investigating the environmental causes of this  puzzling variation in longevity differences could prove illuminating. Sex  differences in response to life-extending genetic or pharmacological  interventions appear surprisingly often in mice. Longevity enhancement due to  reduced signaling through IGF-1 or mTOR signaling typically favors females,  whereas enhancement via a range of pharmacological treatments favors males. These  patterns could be due to interactions of the interventions with sex steroids,  with adiponectin or leptin levels, or with the sex differences in immune function  or the regional distribution of body fat. Clearly, generalizations from one sex  cannot be extended to the other, and inclusion of both sexes in biomedical  studies of human or other animals is worth the effort and expense.

T2  - Experimental gerontology
AB  - In this perspective article, we review the effects of selected anabolic hormones on the motoric system and speculate on the role these hormones may have on  influencing muscle and physical function via their impact on the nervous system.  Both muscle strength and anabolic hormone levels decline around middle age into  old age over a similar time period, and several animal and human studies indicate  that exogenously increasing anabolic hormones (e.g., testosterone and  insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)) in aged subjects is positively associated  with improved muscle strength. While most studies in humans have focused on the  effects of anabolic hormones on muscle growth, few have considered the impact  these hormones have on the motoric system. However, data from animals demonstrate  that administering either testosterone or IGF-1 to cells of the central and  peripheral motor system can increase cell excitability, attenuate atrophic  changes, and improve regenerative capacity of motor neurons. While these studies  do not directly indicate that changes in anabolic hormones contribute to reduced  human performance in the elderly (e.g., muscle weakness and physical  limitations), they do suggest that additional research is warranted along these  lines.

AB  - Aging is associated with impairment of sensorial functions and with the onset of neurodegenerative diseases. As pari passu circulating insulin-like growth factor  1 (IGF-1) bioavailability progressively decreases, we see a direct correlation  with sensory impairment and cognitive performance in older humans. Age-related  sensory loss is typically caused by the irreversible death of highly  differentiated neurons and sensory receptor cells. Among sensory deficits,  age-related hearing loss (ARHL), also named presbycusis, affects one third of the  population over 65 years of age and is a major factor in the progression of  cognitive problems in the elderly. The genetic and molecular bases of ARHL are  largely unknown and only a few genes related to susceptibility to oxidative  stress, excitotoxicity, and cell death have been identified. IGF-1 is known to be  a neuroprotective agent that maintains cellular metabolism, activates growth,  proliferation and differentiation, and limits cell death. Inborn IGF-1 deficiency  leads to profound sensorineural hearing loss both in humans and mice. IGF-1  haploinsufficiency has also been shown to correlate with ARHL. There is not much  information available on the effect of IGF-1 deficiency on other human sensory  systems, but experimental models show a long-term impact on the retina. A  secondary action of IGF-1 is the control of oxidative stress and inflammation,  thus helping to resolve damage situations, acute or made chronic by aging. Here  we will review the primary actions of IGF-1 in the auditory system and the  underlying molecular mechanisms.

AB  - Considering the expansion of human life-span over the past few decades; sarcopenia, a physiological consequence of aging process characterized with a  diminution in mass and strength of skeletal muscle, has become more frequent.  Thus, there is a growing need for expanding our knowledge on the molecular  mechanisms of muscle atrophy in sarcopenia which are complex and involve many  signaling pathways associated with protein degradation and synthesis. MicroRNAs  (miRNAs) as evolutionary conserved small RNAs, could complementarily bind to  their target mRNAs and post-transcriptionally inhibit their translation. Aberrant  expression of miRNAs contributes to the development of sarcopenia by regulating  the expression of critical genes involved in age-related skeletal muscle mass  loss. Here we have a review on the signaling pathways along with the miRNAs  controlling their components expression and subsequently we provide a brief  overview on the effects of exercise on expression pattern of miRNAs in  sarcopenia.

AU  - Kemp, Michael G.

T2  - Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)
AB  - The growing incidence of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) necessitates a thorough understanding of its primary risk factors, which include exposure to ultraviolet  (UV) wavelengths of sunlight and age. Whereas UV radiation (UVR) has long been  known to generate photoproducts in genomic DNA that promote genetic mutations  that drive skin carcinogenesis, the mechanism by which age contributes to disease  pathogenesis is less understood and has not been sufficiently studied. In this  review, we highlight studies that have considered age as a variable in examining  DNA damage responses in UV-irradiated skin and then discuss emerging evidence  that the reduced production of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) by senescent  fibroblasts in the dermis of geriatric skin creates an environment that  negatively impacts how epidermal keratinocytes respond to UVR-induced DNA damage.  In particular, recent data suggest that two principle components of the cellular  response to DNA damage, including nucleotide excision repair and DNA damage  checkpoint signaling, are both partially defective in keratinocytes with inactive  IGF-1 receptors. Overcoming these tumor-promoting conditions in aged skin may  therefore provide a way to lower aging-associated skin cancer risk, and thus we  will consider how dermal wounding and related clinical interventions may work to  rejuvenate the skin, re-activate IGF-1 signaling, and prevent the initiation of  NMSC.

TI  - Fat tissue and long life.
AU  - Bluher, Matthias
T2  - Obesity facts
AB  - Studies over the last several years have revealed important roles of the body fat content, caloric intake and nutrition, insulin/IGF-1 signaling systems, and  pathways involved in oxidative stress and control of protein acetylation on life  span. Although the discovery of longevity genes supports the concept that life  span is genetically determined, adipose tissue seems to be a pivotal organ in the  aging process and in the determination of life span. Leanness and caloric  restriction have been shown to increase longevity in organisms ranging from yeast  to mammals. Increased longevity in mice with a fat-specific disruption of the  insulin receptor gene (FIRKO) suggests that reduced adiposity, even in the  presence of normal or increased food intake, leads to an extended life span.  Reduced fat mass has an impact on longevity in a number of other model organisms.  In Drosophila, a specific reduction in the fat body through overexpression of  forkhead type transcription factor (dFOXO) extends life span. Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1),  the mammalian ortholog of the life-extending yeast gene silent information  regulator 2 (SIR2), was proposed to be involved in the molecular mechanisms  linking life span to adipose tissue. Moreover, in the control of human aging and  longevity, one of the striking physiological characteristics identified in  centenarians is their greatly increased insulin sensitivity even compared with  younger individuals. On the other hand, overweight and obesity seem to be  associated with decreased life span in humans. In addition, it was recently shown  that modifiable risk factors during the later years of life, including smoking,  obesity, and hypertension, are associated not only with lower life expectancy,  but also with poor health and function during older age. There is growing  evidence that the effect of reduced adipose tissue mass on life span could be due  to the prevention of obesity-related metabolic disorders including type 2  diabetes and atherosclerosis.

AU  - Jin, Tianru

AU  - Sun, Jane
T2  - Cellular signalling
AB  - The bipartite transcription factor beta-catenin/TCF (cat/TCF) has been recognized as the major effector of the Wnt signaling pathway for more than a decade, and  its over-activation has been associated with malignancy such as colon and breast  cancer. Extensive examination in different cell lineages has shown that the  activity of cat/TCF can be stimulated by mechanisms other than via the Wnt  glycoproteins, including the stimulation of beta-cat nuclear translocation and  enhanced binding of cat/TCF to the Wnt target gene promoters by insulin and  insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). In addition, the heterotrimeric G proteins  of the G(12) subfamily can interact with the cytoplasmic domain of cadherins,  resulting in the release of the transcriptional activator beta-cat. Furthermore,  certain peptide hormones may stimulate cat/TCF-mediated gene transcription via  activation of their corresponding G-protein coupled receptors. Recently, the  serine/threonine kinase GSK-3 has been recognized to coordinate with AMP  activated protein kinase (AMPK) in phosphorylation and activation of TSC2, the  major component of the tumor suppressor complex TSC1/2. Thus, Wnt activation can  stimulate protein translation via GSK-3 and TSC1/2 inactivation, followed by mTOR  activation. Finally, beta-cat also functions as a pivotal molecule in defense  against oxidative stress via serving as a partner of forkhead box O (FOXO)  transcription factors. Thus, FOXO proteins, which mainly mediate aging and stress  signaling, and TCF factors, which mainly mediate developmental and proliferation  signaling, compete for a limited pool of free beta-cat. Insulin and growth  factors, on the other hand, control the balance between TCF- and FOXO-mediated  gene transcription via phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion of FOXO proteins.  These observations provide new insight to understand how Wnt, insulin/growth  factors, and FOXOs are involved in versatile physiological events and the  development and progression of various human diseases.

T2  - Fertility and sterility
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the current literature for the effect of hormones used in rejuvenation clinics on the maintenance of spermatogenesis. DESIGN: Review of  published literature. SETTING: Not applicable. PATIENT(S): Men who have undergone  exogenous testosterone (T) and/or anabolic androgenic steroid (AAS) therapies.  INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Semen analysis, pregnancy  outcomes, and time to recovery of spermatogenesis. RESULT(S): Exogenous  testosterone and anabolic androgenic steroids suppress intratesticular  testosterone production, which may lead to azoospermia or severe oligozoospermia.  Therapies that protect spermatogenesis involve human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)  therapy and selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs). The studies examining  the effect of human growth hormone (HGH) on infertile men are uncontrolled and  unconvincing, but they do not appear to negatively impact spermatogenesis. At  present, routine use of aromatase inhibitors is not recommended based on a lack  of long-term data. CONCLUSION(S): The use of hormones for rejuvenation is  increasing with the aging of the Baby Boomer population. Men desiring children at  a later age may be unaware of the side-effect profile of hormones used at  rejuvenation centers. Testosterone and anabolic androgenic steroids have  well-established detrimental effects on spermatogenesis, but recovery may be  possible with cessation. Clomiphene citrate, human growth hormone  (HGH)/insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG),  and aromatase inhibitors do not appear to have significant negative effects on  sperm production, but quality data are lacking.

AB  - Human aging is characterized by skeletal muscle wasting, a debilitating condition which sets the susceptibility for diseases that directly affect the quality of  life and often limit life span. Sarcopenia, i.e. the reduction of muscle mass  and/or function, is the consequence of a reduction of protein synthesis and an  increase in muscle protein degradation. In addition, the capacity for muscle  regeneration is severely impaired in aging and this can lead to disability,  particularly in patients with other concomitant diseases or organ impairment.  Immobility and lack of exercise, increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines,  increased production of oxygen free radicals or impaired detoxification, low  anabolic hormone output, malnutrition and reduced neurological drive have been  advocated as being responsible for sarcopenia. It is intriguing to notice that  multiple pathways converge on skeletal muscle dysfunction, but the factors  involved sometimes diverge to different pathways, thus intersecting at critical  points. It is reasonable to argue that the activity of these nodes results from  the net balance of regulating mechanisms, as in the case of the GH/IGF-1 axis,  the testosterone and cortisol functions, the pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines  and receptors. Both genetic and epigenetic mechanisms operate in regulating the  final phenotype, the extent of muscle atrophy and reduction in strength and force  generation. It is widely accepted that intervention on lifestyle habits  represents an affordable and practical way to modify on a large scale some  detrimental outcomes of aging, and particularly sarcopenia. The identification of  the molecular chain able to reverse sarcopenia is a major goal of studies on  human aging.

TI  - Calorie restriction mimetics: can you have your cake and eat it, too?
AU  - Ingram, Donald K.
AU  - Roth, George S.
T2  - Ageing research reviews
AB  - Strong consensus exists regarding the most robust environmental intervention for attenuating aging processes and increasing healthspan and lifespan: calorie  restriction (CR). Over several decades, this paradigm has been replicated in  numerous nonhuman models, and has been expanded over the last decade to formal,  controlled human studies of CR. Given that long-term CR can create heavy  challenges to compliance in human diets, the concept of a calorie restriction  mimetic (CRM) has emerged as an active research area within gerontology. In past  presentations on this subject, we have proposed that a CRM is a compound that  mimics metabolic, hormonal, and physiological effects of CR, activates stress  response pathways observed in CR and enhances stress protection, produces CR-like  effects on longevity, reduces age-related disease, and maintains more youthful  function, all without significantly reducing food intake, at least initially.  Over 16 years ago, we proposed that glycolytic inhibition could be an effective  strategy for developing CRM. The main argument here is that inhibiting energy  utilization as far upstream as possible provides the highest chance of generating  a broad spectrum of CR-like effects when compared to targeting a singular  molecular target downstream. As an initial candidate CRM, 2-deoxyglucose, a known  anti-glycolytic, was shown to produce a remarkable phenotype of CR, but further  investigation found that this compound produced cardiotoxicity in rats at the  doses we had been using. There remains interest in 2DG as a CRM but at lower  doses. Beyond the proposal of 2DG as a candidate CRM, the field has grown  steadily with many investigators proposing other strategies, including novel  anti-glycolytics. Within the realm of upstream targeting at the level of the  digestive system, research has included bariatric surgery, inhibitors of fat  digestion/absorption, and inhibitors of carbohydrate digestion. Research focused  on downstream sites has included insulin receptors, IGF-1 receptors, sirtuin  activators, inhibitors of mTOR, and polyamines. In the current review we discuss  progress made involving these various strategies and comment on the status and  future for each within this exciting research field.

AB  - Mutant animals characterized by extended longevity provide valuable tools to study the mechanisms of aging. Growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-1  (IGF-1) constitute one of the well-established pathways involved in the  regulation of aging and lifespan. Ames and Snell dwarf mice characterized by GH  deficiency as well as growth hormone receptor/growth hormone binding protein  knockout (GHRKO) mice characterized by GH resistance live significantly longer  than genetically normal animals. During normal aging of rodents and humans there  is increased insulin resistance, disruption of metabolic activities and decline  of the function of the immune system. All of these age related processes promote  inflammatory activity, causing long term tissue damage and systemic chronic  inflammation. However, studies of long living mutants and calorie restricted  animals show decreased pro-inflammatory activity with increased levels of  anti-inflammatory adipokines such as adiponectin. At the same time, these animals  have improved insulin signaling and carbohydrate homeostasis that relate to  alterations in the secretory profile of adipose tissue including increased  production and release of anti-inflammatory adipokines. This suggests that  reduced inflammation promoting healthy metabolism may represent one of the major  mechanisms of extended longevity in long-lived mutant mice and likely also in the  human.

TI  - Role of the IGF/insulin system in longevity.
AU  - Mari, D.
T2  - Minerva endocrinologica
AB  - Human life expectancy is influenced by multiple determinants, including various environmental and genetic factors. Though the non-genetic factors are important,  it is estimated that approximately 25-32% of the overall difference in human  lifespan for survival after the age of 60 years depends on for by genetic  polymorphisms among individuals. In addition, there are human homologues to many  genes that affect lifespan in model organisms. In people, longevity genes might  slow the rate of age-related changes in cells, increase resistance to  environmental stresses like infection and injury, and reduce the risk of many  age-related conditions. The best studied longevity pathway is probably the one  involving insulin/IGF-1 signaling. The important role of IGF and insulin-related  signaling pathways in the control of longevity of worms and insects is very well  documented. In the mouse, several spontaneous or experimentally induced mutations  that interfere with GH/IGF axis modulation lead to extended longevity. Increases  in the average life span in these mutants range from approximately 20-70%  depending on the nature of the endocrine defect, gender, diet, and/or genetic  background. All the data in animals models and in the population studies support  the evidence that this pathway drives an evolutionarily conserved network that  regulates lifespan and affects longevity across species. Results obtained in  humans are still controversial and further extensive studies are required to  firmly establish a role of the IGF1 axis in modulation of human longevity. A  better knowledge of the role of this pathway in humans may assist in the design  of improved treatment methods for age-related diseases, delay the aging process  and prolong the human lifespan.

TI  - Insulin-like growth factor 1 resistance in chronic renal failure.
AU  - Fouque, D.
T2  - Mineral and electrolyte metabolism
AB  - Renal failure is characterized by endocrine and metabolic disorders, some of them being described as a state of resistance to growth hormone (GH) and/or  insulin-like growth factor (IGF) 1. There is evidence for a reduced metabolic  action of IGF-1 (formerly somatomedin C) in hemodialysis and kidney transplant  children and in adults undergoing hemodialysis. Since the development of  recombinant human (rh) IGF-1, despite strong metabolic actions, some experimental  studies suggest a decrease in metabolic effects of rhIGF-1 in chronic renal  failure (CRF). Preliminary reports in adult dialysis patients also stressed the  possibility of a resistance to rhIGF-1 metabolic actions. The perturbed  IGF-binding protein system in CRF may play an important role in modifying storage  and IGF-I delivery to tissues. Also, by analogy with insulin, receptor and  postreceptor defects may be involved in this condition, as suggested by rhIGF-1  resistance with aging or in obese Zucker rats. However, rhIGF-1 remains a potent  anabolic factor in uremia. Further studies will therefore be necessary to clarify  this IGF-1 resistance state. Such knowledge might allow physicians to reduce the  amount of rhIGF-1 administered to the patients and improve the anabolic actions  of rhIGF-1 during acute and chronic renal failure.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In mammals, the IGF-1 pathway affects the phenotype of aging. Since the function of the immune system is modulated by IGF-1, it is plausible that  immunosenescence might in part result from altered control by this pathway. We  therefore examined whether the expression of IGF-1R, FOXO1, and FOXO3a in  peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) changes with age and if this might be  due to changes in the expression of select miRNAs. METHODS: The expression of  IGF-1R, FOXO1, FOXO3a, as well as of miR-9, miR-96, miR-99a, miR-132, miR-145,  and miR-182 was examined in PBMC of young (27.8 ± 3.7 years), elderly  (65.6 ± 3.4 years), and long-lived (94.0 ± 3.7 years) Polish Caucasians using  real-time PCR. mRNA/miRNA interactions were studied in HEK 293 cells using  luciferase-expressing pmirGLO reporter vector. RESULTS: The median expression of  IGF-1R decreased with age (p < 0.000001), as did the expression of FOXO1  (p < 0.000001), while the expression of FOXO3a remained stable. We also found an  age-associated increase of the median expression of miR-96 (p = 0.002), miR-145  (p = 0.024) and miR-9 (p = 0.026), decrease of the expression of miR-99a  (p = 0.037), and no changes regarding miR-132 and miR-182. Functional studies  revealed that miR-96 and miR-182 interacted with human IGF-1R mRNA, and that  miR-145 and miR-132 interacted with human FOXO1 mRNA. CONCLUSIONS: The  age-associated higher expression of miR-96 and miR-145 might contribute to the  lower expression of IGF-1R while the higher expression of miR-96, miR-145 and  miR-9 might contribute to the lower expression of FOXO1 in peripheral blood  mononuclear cells of aging humans. Sustained expression/function of FOXO3a but  not of the other two genes might be important for the maintenance of the immune  system function in these individuals.

AB  - Estrogen is the proximate sex steroid sustaining GH secretion throughout the human life span in both sexes. However, very little is known about the specific  neuroendocrine mechanisms by which estrogen activates and maintains GH secretion  in the young or aging human. The identification of somatostatin in 1973 as a key  negative peptidyl regulator of the GH axis and the discovery of GH-releasing  hormone (GHRH) in 1982 as a dominant feedforward agonist of GH secretion provided  an initial basic science foundation for exploring sex-steroid control of the  GH-IGF-1 axis. Although GH-releasing peptides (GHRPs) were first recognized in  1977-1981, subsequent cloning of hypothalamopituitary receptors transducing  potent secretagogue actions of GHRPs in 1996 and of an endogenous ligand for this  effector pathway in 1999 now extend the framework for examining the mechanisms of  estrogen-driven GH secretion in aging. Herein, we review several novel and  multifaceted interactions in postmenopausal women between estrogen and GHRP-2. We  combine these observations into a simplified construct of GH-axis neuroregulation  comprising the somatostatin, GHRH, and GHRP effector pathways, as well as GH and  IGF-1 autofeedback. We suggest the thesis that estrogen controls the interfaces  among these pivotal regulatory peptides in hyposomatotropic postmenopausal  individuals.

TI  - Countering neurodegeneration by reducing the activity of the insulin/IGF signaling pathway: current knowledge and future prospects.
AU  - Cohen, Ehud
T2  - Experimental gerontology
AB  - Human neurodegenerative maladies share two common key features: a mechanistic link to the accumulation and deposition of aberrantly aggregated proteins and  late onset. These similarities among otherwise unrelated disorders suggest that  the aging process plays an active role in enabling the emergence of these  diseases late in life. Invertebrate-based studies have shown that the  manipulation of aging by the reduction of the Insulin/IGF signaling (IIS), a  prominent aging regulatory pathway, protects model organisms from  neurodegeneration-linked toxic protein aggregation. Recent studies have also  indicated that the counter proteotoxic effect of IIS reduction is conserved from  worms to mice as reduced IGF-1 signaling protected Alzheimer's-model mice from  the disease-like behavioral impairments, pathological phenotypes and premature  death typical to these model animals. In this article I review the current  knowledge on the protective mechanisms that are suppressed by the IIS and discuss  the future therapeutic potential of IIS reduction as a treatment for  neurodegenerative disorders.

TI  - Regulation of excitation contraction coupling by insulin-like growth factor-1 in aging skeletal muscle.
AU  - Delbono, O.
T2  - The journal of nutrition, health & aging
AB  - Excitation-contraction (EC) uncoupling is a primary muscle alteration and constitutes a major cause of decline in skeletal muscle force with aging. The  structural substratum for EC uncoupling in muscles from aging mammals is a  reduction in number of dihydropyridine receptors (DHPR) at the T-tubule and SR  membrane leading to an increase in the percent of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium  release channels or ryanodine receptors (RyR1) uncoupled to DHPR. The main  functional consequence of this alteration is a failure in the transduction of  sarcolemmal depolarization into a calcium signal and a mechanical response. This  review summarizes recent studies from our laboratory aimed at elucidating the  modulation of EC coupling by insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) in skeletal  muscle. We demonstrated that transgenic overexpression of human IGF-1 exclusively  in skeletal muscle increases the number and prevents age-related decline in the  number of DHPR. IGF-1 enhances rat skeletal muscle DHPR function and gene  expression. The functional significance of these findings is that IGF-1 prevents  the age-related decline in muscle force.

TI  - Plasticity and function of human skeletal muscle in relation to disuse and rehabilitation: Influence of ageing and surgery.
AU  - Suetta, Charlotte
T2  - Danish medical journal
AB  - In order to study the influence of disuse and aging on skeletal muscle homeostasis, different human models were employed. Effects of chronic disuse were  investigated in elderly patients suffering from uni-lateral hip-osteoarthritis,  whereas the effect of short-term disuse (4 and 14 days of unilateral lower limb  immobilisation) was assessed in healthy young and old individuals. In summary,  chronic muscle disuse in the elderly was associated with marked quantitative as  well as qualitative neuromuscular impairments. More specifically, decreases were  observed in muscle strength, quadriceps muscle size and myofibre area, muscle  architecture, contractile properties and neuromuscular activation. Furthermore,  substantial side-to-side differences in specific strength (MVC/LCSA) and  normalised rapid muscle force capacity (RFD/CSA) were observed, indicating that a  significant part of the observed changes in mechanical muscle function with  disuse were explained by impairments in muscle quality. Importantly, within the  first 4 days of immobility the ob-served atrophy responses did not seem affected  by age, as manifested by comparable reductions in myofibre area in young and old  individuals. However, in line with previous observations using various animal  models, we observed a larger loss in muscle mass in young compared to older  individuals after more prolonged immobilisation (14 days). Conversely, old  individuals were more negatively affected with respect to neural function and  rapid force characteristics than their young counterparts. Moreover, we showed  that the initiation and regulation of human skeletal muscle atrophy with  short-term disuse is age-dependant. Based on the present experiments it can be  concluded that a multitude of signalling pathways related to both muscle atrophy  and protein synthesis are activated in the initial phase of disuse, which in turn  lead to a rapid initial atrophy response (~1-4 days) in both young and old  individuals followed by a gradually attenuated atrophy response at later  time-points (~2 weeks). Notably, during the first 1-2 days of immobility a  parallel activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and the IGF-1/Akt pathway  seem to occur along with a deactivation of PGC-1α and PGC-1β, suggesting that  cellular proteolysis plays an important role in the initiation of human disuse  atrophy in both young and old muscle, whereas the concurrent regulation in  protein synthesis signalling and proteolysis inhibition appears to affect young  adults more pronouncedly compared to older adults. Gaining a better understanding  of the ability of human skele-tal muscle to recover from disuse-induced atrophy  has important implications for the development and implementation of effective  countermeasures against physical frailty in the increasing population of elderly.  Importantly therefore, the present experiments demonstrate that resistance  training is highly effective of increasing maximal muscle strength and  neuromuscular function in elderly post-operative patients. Importantly, these  increases in mechanical muscle function were accompanied by gains in muscle size,  architecture and in the expression of IGF-I mRNA splice variants, resembling that  typically seen in young healthy individuals when exposed to resistance training.  In contrast, these positive adaptations could not be achieved with the use of  neuromuscular electrical stimulation or conventional rehabilitation efforts  alone. Collectively, these findings strongly underline the importance of  implementing resistive exercises in future rehabilitation programs for elderly  individuals. In addition, comparing young and old able-bodied individuals, we  observed that the magnitude and time-course of changes in mechanical muscle  function during the recovery phase following short-term disuse were compromised  in old compared to young individuals. Likewise, aged individuals demonstrated an  impaired response to re-loading reflected by attenuated gains in myofibre area,  in parallel with smaller increases in satellite cell number despite no  age-related differences were observed in factors known to promote skeletal muscle  hypertrophy and myogenic stem cell proliferation (IGF-Ea, MGF, MyoD, myogenin,  HGF). Moreover, an age-specific regulation in myostatin mRNA expression was  observed, characterized by an amplified increase in aging skeletal muscle with  immobilisation that was followed by less down-regulation during the subsequent  phase of re-loading. In combination with an association observed between the  changes in myostatin expression and satellite cell proliferation in the acute  phase of re-loading, these data indicates that myostatin play an important role  in the impaired ability of aged human skeletal muscle.

AB  - Growth hormone receptor deficiency (GHRD) results in short stature, enhanced insulin sensitivity, and low circulating levels of insulin and insulin-like  growth factor 1 (IGF-1). Previous studies in mice and humans suggested that GHRD  has protective effects against age-related diseases, including cancer and  diabetes. Whereas GHRD mice show improved age-dependent cognitive performance,  the effect of GHRD on human cognition remains unknown. Using MRI, we compared  brain structure, function, and connectivity between 13 people with GHRD and 12  unaffected relatives. We assessed differences in white matter microstructural  integrity, hippocampal volume, subregional volumes, and cortical thickness and  surface area of selected regions. We also evaluated brain activity at rest and  during a hippocampal-dependent pattern separation task. The GHRD group had larger  surface areas in several frontal and cingulate regions and showed trends toward  larger dentate gyrus and CA1 regions of the hippocampus. They had lower mean  diffusivity in the genu of the corpus callosum and the anterior thalamic tracts.  The GHRD group showed enhanced cognitive performance and greater task-related  activation in frontal, parietal, and hippocampal regions compared with controls.  Furthermore, they had greater functional synchronicity of activity between the  precuneus and the rest of the default mode network at rest. The results suggest  that, compared with controls, GHRD subjects have brain structure and function  that are more consistent with those observed in younger adults reported in  previous studies. Further investigation may lead to improved understanding of  underlying mechanisms and could contribute to the identification of treatments  for age-related cognitive deficits.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT People and mice with  growth hormone receptor deficiency (GHRD or Laron syndrome) are protected against  age-related diseases including cancer and diabetes. However, in humans, it is  unknown whether cognitive function and brain structure are affected by GHRD.  Using MRI, we examined cognition in an Ecuadorian population with GHRD and their  unaffected relatives. The GHRD group showed better memory performance than their  relatives. The differences in brain structure and function that we saw between  the two groups were not consistent with variations typically associated with  brain deficits. This study contributes to our understanding of the connection  between growth genes and brain aging in humans and provides data indicating that  GHR inhibition has the potential to protect against age-dependent cognitive  decline.

AB  - Mutations that inhibit the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) extend the lifespan of worms, flies and mice. However, it appears that relatively low  circulating levels of IGF-1 in humans are associated with aging-related diseases  and diminished longevity. As leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is ostensibly a  biomarker of human aging, we examined the relationship between LTL and blood  IGF-1 in a healthy cohort. Our sample comprised 476 healthy, unrelated Caucasians  (208 men and 268 women), aged 16-104 years, living in the West Coast of Southern  Italy. We measured LTL by Southern blots and IGF-1 by enzyme-linked immunoassay.  Both IGF-1 and LTL diminished with age (IGF-1, r=-0.601, P<0.001; LTL, r=-0.706,  P<0.001). Age-adjusted LTL was positively associated with IGF-1 level throughout  the age range of the cohort (r=0.270, P<0.001). IGF-1 accounted for about 10% of  the inter-individual variation in LTL over and above the effect of age. Our  findings suggest that both circulating IGF-1 and LTL are indices of healthy aging  in humans. Further research will be necessary to establish whether LTL will  ultimately be used in clinical settings as an index of healthy aging.

TI  - Growth factor enhancement of muscle regeneration: a central role of IGF-1.
AU  - Musarò, A.
T2  - Archives italiennes de biologie
AB  - The prolongation of skeletal muscle strength in aging and neuromuscular disease has been the objective of numerous studies employing a variety of approaches. In  the last decade, dramatic progress has been made in elucidating the molecular  defects underlying a number of muscle diseases. With the characterization of  mutations responsible for muscle dysfunction in several inherited pathologies,  and the identification of novel signaling pathways, subtle alterations in which  can lead to significant defects in muscle metabolism, the field is poised to  devise successful strategies for treatment of this debilitating and often fatal  group of human ailments. Yet progress has been slow in therapeutic applications  of our newly gained knowledge. The complexity of muscle types, the intimate  relationship between structural integrity and mechanical function, and the  sensitivity of skeletal muscle to metabolic perturbations have impeded rapid  progress in successful clinical intervention. The relatively poor regenerative  properties of striated muscle compound also the devastating effects of muscle  degeneration.

TI  - Control of adrenal androgen secretion.
AU  - Parker, L. N.
T2  - Endocrinology and metabolism clinics of North America
AB  - The human adrenal gland secretes large amounts of androgens and androgenic precursors as compared with the adrenal glands of other species. In part, this  pattern of secretion is regulated by ACTH, analogous to the control of cortisol.  However, in many instances, including adrenarche, puberty, aging, and severe  illness, secretion of adrenal androgens and cortisol diverge for reasons which  are not clear. Factors endogenous to the adrenal gland may have a role in the  modulation of adrenal androgen secretion. These include the centripetal blood  supply of the adrenal gland, availability of cofactors of steroidogenic enzymes,  and intrinsic properties of adrenal cells or enzymes. However, these mechanisms  may, in turn, be modified by factors exogenous to the adrenal gland. Possible  evidence for a regulatory role for such known substances as growth hormone,  IGF-1, gonadotropins, estrogens, angiotensins, prostaglandins, insulin, EGF, and  POMC-related peptides is discussed. Furthermore, pituitary or extrapituitary  substances, in addition to known hormones, may have a role in the control of  adrenal androgen secretion. Several lines of evidence include the inability of  ACTH to maintain a normal adrenal androgen/cortisol ratio in adrenally suppressed  patients, or experimentally, in hypophysectomized chimpanzees. Evidence for such  factors derived from fetal and adult human pituitary gland is discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Aging is marked by declines in levels of many sex hormones and growth factors, as well as in cognitive function. The P300 event-related potential has  been established as a predictor of cognitive decline. We decided to determine if  this measure, as well as 2 standard tests of memory and attention, may be  correlated with serum levels of sex hormones and growth factors, and if there are  any generalizations that could be made based on these parameters and the aging  process. FINDINGS: In this large clinically based preliminary study several  sex-stratified associations between hormone levels and cognition were observed,  including (1) for males aged 30 to 49, both IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 significantly  associated negatively with prolonged P300 latency; (2) for males aged 30 to 49,  the spearman correlation between prolonged P300 latency and low free testosterone  was significant; (3) for males aged 60 to 69, there was a significant negative  correlation between P300 latency and DHEA levels; (4) for females aged 50 to 59  IGFBP-3 significantly associated negatively with prolonged P300 latency; (5) for  females at all age periods, estrogen and progesterone were uncorrelated with P300  latency; and (6) for females aged 40 to 69, there was significant negative  correlation between DHEA levels and P300 latency. Moreover there were no  statistically significant correlations between any hormone and Wechsler Memory  Scale-III (WMS-111). However, in females, there was a significant positive  correlation between estrogen levels and the number of Attention Deficit Disorder  (ADD) complaints. CONCLUSION: Given certain caveats including confounding factors  involving psychiatric and other chronic diseases as well as medications, the  results may still have important value. If these results could be confirmed in a  more rigorously controlled investigation, it may have important value in the  diagnosis, prevention and treatment of cognitive impairments and decline.

TI  - Unravelling of hidden secrets: The role of vitamin D in skin aging.
AU  - Reichrath, Jörg
T2  - Dermato-endocrinology
AB  - The skin is the only tissue in the human body that represents both a target tissue for biologically active vitamin D compounds including  1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D] and has the capacity for the synthesis of  1,25(OH)2D from 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC). Recent findings indicate that the  vitamin D endocrine system (VDES), besides multiple other important functions,  regulates aging in many tissues, including skin. This concept is strongly  supported by several independent studies in genetically modified mice (including  FGF23(-/-) and Klotho(-/-) mice) that are characterized by altered mineral  homeostasis caused by a high vitamin D activity. These mice typically have  phenotypic features of premature aging that include, besides short lifespan,  retarded growth, ectopic calcification, immunological deficiency, osteoporosis,  atherosclerosis, hypogonadism, skin and general organ atrophy. Notably, it has  been demonstrated that these phenotypic features can be reversed by normalizing  mineral homeostasis and/or vitamin D status. Interestingly, the aging phenotypes  of mice suffering from hypovitaminosis D (VDR(-/-) and CYP27B1(-/-) mice) are  quite similar to those suffering from hypervitaminosis D (including FGF-23(-/-)  and Klotho(-/-) mice). Consequently, it has been hypothesized that thus, both  hypo- and hypervitaminosis D may enhance aging. Aging seems to show a U-shaped  response curve to vitamin D status, and, therefore normovitaminosis D seems to be  important for preventing premature aging. Additionally, laboratory investigations  have now convincingly shown that vitamin D compounds protect the skin against the  hazardous effects of various skin aging-inducing agents, including ultraviolet  (UV) radiation. In conclusion, these findings support the concept that  UV-radiation exerts both skin aging -promoting and -inhibiting effects, the  latter via induction of cutaneous vitamin D synthesis. Future studies will  clarify the effect of vitamin D compounds on expression and function of potential  key regulators of skin aging, such as TAp63 or the IGF-1 signaling pathway.  Furthermore, the efficacy of topically applied vitamin D compounds in the  prevention of skin aging has to be evaluated in future clinical trials.

AB  - CONTEXT: Cushing's syndrome is characterized by marked changes in body composition (sarcopenia, obesity, and osteoporosis) that have similarities with  those seen in aging. 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) converts  glucocorticoids to their active form (cortisone to cortisol in humans), resulting  in local tissue amplification of effect. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate 11β-HSD1  expression and activity with age, specifically in muscle. To determine putative  causes for increased activity with age and its consequences upon phenotypic  markers of adverse aging. DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study. SETTING:  National Institute for Health Research-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility,  Birmingham, United Kingdom. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Healthy human  volunteers age 20 to 81 years (n = 134; 77 women, 57 men). INTERVENTIONS: Day  attendance at research facility for baseline observations, body composition  analysis by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, jump-plate mechanography, grip  strength analysis, baseline biochemical profiling, urine collection, and vastus  lateralis muscle biopsy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Skeletal muscle gene  expression, urine steroid profile, bivariate correlations between  expression/activity and phenotypic/biochemical variables. RESULTS: Skeletal  muscle 11β-HSD1 expression was increased 2.72-fold in women over 60 years of age  compared to those aged 20-40 years; no differences were observed in men. There  was a significant positive correlation between skeletal muscle 11β-HSD1  expression and age in women across the group (rho = 0.40; P = .009). No  differences in expression of 11β-HSD type 2, glucocorticoid receptor, or  hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase between age groups were observed in either sex.  Urinary steroid markers of 11β-HSD1, 11β-HSD type 2, or 5α-reductase were similar  between age groups. Skeletal muscle 11β-HSD1 expression was associated with  reduced grip strength in both sexes and correlated positively with percentage of  body fat, homeostasis model of assessment for insulin resistance, total  cholesterol, LH, and FSH and negatively with bone mineral content and IGF-1 in  women. CONCLUSIONS: Skeletal muscle 11β-HSD1 is up-regulated with age in women  and is associated with reduced grip strength, insulin resistance, and an adverse  body composition profile. Selective inhibition of 11β-HSD1 may offer a novel  strategy to prevent and/or reverse age-related sarcopenia.

AB  - Aging is associated with an increased risk for atherosclerosis. A possible cause is low numbers and dysfunction of endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) which  insufficiently repair damaged vascular walls. We hypothesized that decreased  levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) during age contribute to  dysfunctional EPC. We measured the effect of growth hormone (GH), which increases  endogenous IGF-1 levels, on EPC in mice and human subjects. We compared EPC  number and function in healthy middle-aged male volunteers (57.4+/-1.4 years)  before and after a 10 day treatment with recombinant GH (0.4 mg/d) with that of  younger and elderly male subjects (27.5+/-0.9 and 74.1+/-0.9 years). Middle-aged  and elderly subjects had lower circulating CD133(+)/VEGFR-2(+) EPC with impaired  function and increased senescence. GH treatment in middle-aged subjects elevated  IGF-1 levels (126.0+/-7.2 ng/mL versus 241.1+/-13.8 ng/mL; P<0.0001), increased  circulating EPC with improved colony forming and migratory capacity, enhanced  incorporation into tube-like structures, and augmented endothelial nitric oxide  synthase expression in EPC comparable to that of the younger group. EPC  senescence was attenuated, whereas telomerase activity was increased after GH  treatment. Treatment of aged mice with GH (7 days) or IGF-1 increased IGF-1 and  EPC levels and improved EPC function, whereas a two day GH treatment did not  alter IGF-1 or EPC levels. Ex vivo treatment of EPC from elderly individuals with  IGF-1 improved function and attenuated cellular senescence. IGF-1 stimulated EPC  differentiation, migratory capacity and the ability to incorporate into forming  vascular networks in vitro via the IGF-1 receptor. IGF-1 increased telomerase  activity, endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression, phosphorylation and  activity in EPC in a phosphoinositide-3-kinase/Akt dependent manner. Small  interference RNA-mediated knockdown of endothelial nitric oxide synthase in EPC  abolished the IGF-1 effects. Growth hormone-mediated increase in IGF-1 reverses  age-related EPC dysfunction and may be a novel therapeutic strategy against  vascular disorders with impairment of EPC.

AB  - BackgroundThe relative role of skeletal muscle mechano‐transduction in comparison with systemic hormones, such as testosterone (T), in regulating hypertrophic responses to exercise is contentious. We investigated the mechanistic effects of chemical endogenous T depletion adjuvant to 6 weeks of resistance exercise training (RET) on muscle mass, function, myogenic regulatory factors, and muscle anabolic signalling in younger men.MethodsNon‐hypogonadal men (n = 16; 18–30 years) were randomized in a double‐blinded fashion to receive placebo (P, saline n = 8) or the GnRH analogue, Goserelin [Zoladex (Z), 3.6 mg, n = 8], injections, before 6 weeks of supervised whole‐body RET. Participants underwent dual‐energy X‐ray absorptiometry (DXA), ultrasound of m. vastus lateralis (VL), and VL biopsies for assessment of cumulative muscle protein synthesis (MPS), myogenic gene expression, and anabolic signalling pathway responses.ResultsZoladex suppressed endogenous T to within the hypogonadal range and was well tolerated; suppression was associated with blunted fat free mass [Z: 55.4 ± 2.8 to 55.8 ± 3.1 kg, P = 0.61 vs. P: 55.9 ± 1.7 to 57.4 ± 1.7 kg, P = 0.006, effect size (ES) = 0.31], composite strength (Z: 40 ± 2.3% vs. P: 49.8 ± 3.3%, P = 0.03, ES = 1.4), and muscle thickness (Z: 2.7 ± 0.4 to 2.69 ± 0.36 cm, P > 0.99 vs. P: 2.74 ± 0.32 to 2.91 ± 0.32 cm, P < 0.0001, ES = 0.48) gains. Hypogonadism attenuated molecular transducers of muscle growth related to T metabolism (e.g. androgen receptor: Z: 1.2 fold, P > 0.99 vs. P: 1.9 fold, P < 0.0001, ES = 0.85), anabolism/myogenesis (e.g. IGF‐1Ea: Z: 1.9 fold, P = 0.5 vs. P: 3.3 fold, P = 0.0005, ES = 0.72; IGF‐1Ec: Z: 2 fold, P > 0.99 vs. P: 4.7 fold, P = 0.0005, ES = 0.68; myogenin: Z: 1.3 fold, P > 0.99 vs. P: 2.7 fold, P = 0.002, ES = 0.72), RNA/DNA (Z: 0.47 ± 0.03 to 0.53 ± 0.03, P = 0.31 vs. P: 0.50 ± 0.01 to 0.64 ± 0.04, P = 0.003, ES = 0.72), and RNA/ASP (Z: 5.8 ± 0.4 to 6.8 ± 0.5, P > 0.99 vs. P: 6.5 ± 0.2 to 8.9 ± 1.1, P = 0.008, ES = 0.63) ratios, as well as acute RET‐induced phosphorylation of growth signalling proteins (e.g. AKTser473: Z: 2.74 ± 0.6, P = 0.2 vs. P: 5.5 ± 1.1 fold change, P < 0.001, ES = 0.54 and mTORC1ser2448: Z: 1.9 ± 0.8, P > 0.99 vs. P: 3.6 ± 1 fold change, P = 0.002, ES = 0.53). Both MPS (Z: 1.45 ± 0.11 to 1.50 ± 0.06%·day−1, P = 0.99 vs. P: 1.5 ± 0.12 to 2.0 ± 0.15%·day−1, P = 0.01, ES = 0.97) and (extrapolated) muscle protein breakdown (Z: 93.16 ± 7.8 vs. P: 129.1 ± 13.8 g·day−1, P = 0.04, ES = 0.92) were reduced with hypogonadism result in lower net protein turnover (3.9 ± 1.1 vs. 1.2 ± 1.1 g·day−1, P = 0.04, ES = 0.95).ConclusionsWe conclude that endogenous T sufficiency has a central role in the up‐regulation of molecular transducers of RET‐induced muscle hypertrophy in humans that cannot be overcome by muscle mechano‐transduction alone.

TI  - Nutraceutical and Dietary Strategies for Up-Regulating Macroautophagy
AU  - McCarty, Mark F
T2  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
AB  - Macroautophagy is a “cell cleansing” process that rids cells of protein aggregates and damaged organelles that may contribute to disease pathogenesis and the dysfunctions associated with aging. Measures which boost longevity and health span in rodents typically up-regulate macroautophagy, and it has often been suggested that safe strategies which can promote this process in humans may contribute to healthful aging. The kinase ULK1 serves as a trigger for autophagy initiation, and the transcription factors TFEB, FOXO1, ATF4 and CHOP promote expression of a number of proteins which mediate macroautophagy. Nutraceutical or dietary measures which stimulate AMPK, SIRT1, eIF5A, and that diminish the activities of AKT and mTORC1, can be expected to boost the activities of these pro-autophagic factors. The activity of AMPK can be stimulated with the phytochemical berberine. SIRT1 activation may be achieved with a range of agents, including ferulic acid, melatonin, urolithin A, N1-methylnicotinamide, nicotinamide riboside, and glucosamine; correction of ubiquinone deficiency may also be useful in this regard, as may dietary strategies such as time-restricted feeding or intermittent fasting. In the context of an age-related decrease in cellular polyamine levels, provision of exogenous spermidine can boost the hypusination reaction required for the appropriate post-translational modification of eIF5A. Low-protein plant-based diets could be expected to increase ATF4 and CHOP expression, while diminishing IGF-I-mediated activation of AKT and mTORC1. Hence, practical strategies for protecting health by up-regulating macroautophagy may be feasible.

AB  - The association between IGF‐1 levels and mortality in humans is complex with low levels being associated with both low and high mortality. The present meta‐analysis investigates this complex relationship between IGF‐1 and all‐cause mortality in prospective cohort studies. A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Cochrane Library up to September 2019. Published studies were eligible for the meta‐analysis if they had a prospective cohort design, a hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for two or more categories of IGF‐1 and were conducted among adults. A random‐effects model with a restricted maximum likelihood heterogeneity variance estimator was used to find combined HRs for all‐cause mortality. Nineteen studies involving 30,876 participants were included. Meta‐analysis of the 19 eligible studies showed that with respect to the low IGF‐1 category, higher IGF‐1 was not associated with increased risk of all‐cause mortality (HR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.68–1.05). Dose–response analysis revealed a U‐shaped relation between IGF‐1 and mortality HR. Pooled results comparing low vs. middle IGF‐1 showed a significant increase of all‐cause mortality (HR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.14–1.57), as well as comparing high vs. middle IGF‐1 categories (HR = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.06–1.44). Finally, we provide data on the association between IGF‐1 levels and the intake of proteins, carbohydrates, certain vitamins/minerals, and specific foods. Both high and low levels of IGF‐1 increase mortality risk, with a specific 120–160 ng/ml range being associated with the lowest mortality. These findings can explain the apparent controversy related to the association between IGF‐1 levels and mortality.

T2  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
AB  - The impacts of menopause on neurodegenerative diseases, especially the changes in steroid hormones, have been well described in cell models, animal models, and humans. However, the therapeutic effects of hormone replacement therapy on postmenopausal women with neurodegenerative diseases remain controversial. The steroid hormones, steroid hormone receptors, and downstream signal pathways in the brain change with aging and contribute to disease progression. Estrogen and progesterone are two steroid hormones which decline in circulation and the brain during menopause. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), which plays an import role in neuroprotection, is rapidly decreased in serum after menopause. Here, we summarize the actions of estrogen, progesterone, and IGF-1 and their signaling pathways in the brain. Since the incidence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is higher in women than in men, the associations of steroid hormone changes and AD are emphasized. The signaling pathways and cellular mechanisms for how steroid hormones and IGF-1 provide neuroprotection are also addressed. Finally, the molecular mechanisms of potential estrogen modulation on N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptors (NMDARs) are also addressed. We provide the viewpoint of why hormone therapy has inconclusive results based on signaling pathways considering their complex response to aging and hormone treatments. Nonetheless, while diagnosable AD may not be treatable by hormone therapy, its preceding stage of mild cognitive impairment may very well be treatable by hormone therapy.

AB  - The identification of plasma proteins that systematically change with age and, independent of chronological age, predict accelerated decline of health is an expanding area of research. Circulating proteins are ideal translational “omics” since they are final effectors of physiological pathways and because physicians are accustomed to use information of plasma proteins as biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and tracking the effectiveness of treatments. Recent technological advancements, including mass spectrometry (MS)‐based proteomics, multiplexed proteomic assay using modified aptamers (SOMAscan), and Proximity Extension Assay (PEA, O‐Link), have allowed for the assessment of thousands of proteins in plasma or other biological matrices, which are potentially translatable into new clinical biomarkers and provide new clues about the mechanisms by which aging is associated with health deterioration and functional decline. We carried out a detailed literature search for proteomic studies performed in different matrices (plasma, serum, urine, saliva, tissues) and species using multiple platforms. Herein, we identified 232 proteins that were age‐associated across studies. Enrichment analysis of the 232 age‐associated proteins revealed metabolic pathways previously connected with biological aging both in animal models and in humans, most remarkably insulin‐like growth factor (IGF) signaling, mitogen‐activated protein kinases (MAPK), hypoxia‐inducible factor 1 (HIF1), cytokine signaling, Forkhead Box O (FOXO) metabolic pathways, folate metabolism, advance glycation end products (AGE), and receptor AGE (RAGE) metabolic pathway. Information on these age‐relevant proteins, likely expanded and validated in longitudinal studies and examined in mechanistic studies, will be essential for patient stratification and the development of new treatments aimed at improving health expectancy.

AB  - The growth hormone (GH)/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) axis plays fundamental roles during development, maturation, and aging. Members of this axis, composed of various ligands, receptors, and binding proteins, are regulated in a tissue- and time-specific manner that requires precise control that is not completely understood. Some of the most recent advances in understanding the implications of this axis in human growth are derived from the identifications of new mutations in the gene encoding the pregnancy-associated plasma protein PAPP-A2 protease that liberates IGFs from their carrier proteins in a selective manner to allow binding to the IGF receptor 1. The identification of three nonrelated families with mutations in the PAPP-A2 gene has shed light on how this protease affects human physiology. This review summarizes our understanding of the implications of PAPP-A2 in growth physiology, obtained from studies in genetically modified animal models and the PAPP-A2 deficient patients known to date.

AB  - The GH/IGF axis is a major regulator of bone formation and resorption and is essential to the achievement of normal skeleton growth and homeostasis. Beyond its key role in bone physiology, the GH/IGF axis has also major pleiotropic endocrine and autocrine/paracrine effects on mineralized tissues throughout life. This article aims to review the literature on GH, IGFs, IGF binding proteins, and their respective receptors in dental tissues, both epithelium (enamel) and mesenchyme (dentin, pulp, and tooth-supporting periodontium). The present review re-examines and refines the expression of the elements of the GH/IGF axis in oral tissues and their in vivo and in vitro mechanisms of action in different mineralizing cell types of the dento-alveolar complex including ameloblasts, odontoblasts, pulp cells, cementoblasts, periodontal ligament cells, and jaw osteoblasts focusing on cell-specific activities. Together, these data emphasize the determinant role of the GH/IGF axis in physiological and pathological development, morphometry, and aging of the teeth, the periodontium, and oral bones in humans, rodents, and other vertebrates. These advancements in oral biology have elicited an enormous interest among investigators to translate the fundamental discoveries on the GH/IGF axis into innovative strategies for targeted oral tissue therapies with local treatments, associated or not with materials, for orthodontics and the repair and regeneration of the dento-alveolar complex and oral bones.

TI  - Calorie Restriction and the Aging Muscle: A Multispecies Approach
AU  - Orenduff, Melissa C.
A3  - Hursting, Stephen D.
AB  - Aging is associated with a progressive decline in muscle mass, strength, and physical function termed sarcopenia.  Sarcopenia is an important risk factor for loss of independence, reduced quality of life, and increased mortality.  Calorie restriction (CR) is an effective dietary treatment for several age-related conditions, including sarcopenia.  Recent work conducted in our laboratory suggests insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is involved in the anti-aging effects of CR.  The aim of this work is to understand the role of circulating IGF-1 in CR-induced effects on aging skeletal muscle.  Using a multispecies approach, we sought to determine if IGF-1-mediated effects of CR are conserved among mice, nonhuman primates, and humans.  As an extension into our investigation of CR and IGF-1 on aging muscle, we conducted an in vivo experiment to examine the role of a CR mimetic, rapamycin, on age-related loss of muscle strength and function.  Our results suggest that the effects of CR on aging skeletal muscle are realized through biological changes consistent with regenerative and repair-related mechanisms and a shift in transcriptional profiles towards improved metabolic and inflammatory signaling pathways that promote enhanced mitochondrial function and biogenesis.  Collectively, this work demonstrates CR-induced effects on aging muscle are, in part, supported by reduced circulating IGF-1.  Further, the CR-mimetic, rapamycin may hold promise as a pharmacological alternative to CR to attenuate loss of muscle strength and function associated with age.

TI  - Interface Scaffold Design Principles for Integrative Cartilage Regeneration
AU  - Mosher, Christopher Zachary
A3  - Lu, Helen H.
AB  - Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease characterized by painful, progressive articular cartilage lesions that deteriorate joint function. It remains leading cause of disability in the United States, affecting nearly 30 million Americans with increasing prevalence in the aging population, which has resulted in an annual economic burden of $128 billion. Symptomatic, full thickness cartilage injuries often require surgical intervention, because the tissue is predominantly avascular and thus has a limited self-healing capacity. However, clinical management strategies including matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation and osteochondral grafting are inadequate in the long-term due to poor integration of cartilage grafts with surrounding host cartilage and subchondral bone. In addition to physical congruence between graft and host cartilage, a structural or chemically functional barrier that limits osseous invasion into the cartilage compartment is critical in order to maintain the integrity of repaired cartilage.Given these significant clinical challenges, the objective of this thesis is to establish design principles for homotypic and heterotypic tissue integration via a cup-shaped fibrous scaffold system that encapsulates cartilage grafts (autologous or engineered), and integrates them simultaneously with host cartilage and bone at their respective interfaces. Additionally, to facilitate clinical translation of the scaffold cup, an innovative “green electrospinning” method is developed using FDA Q3C Class 3 solvents with minimal manufacturing impact on the environment. It is hypothesized that, to fuse cartilage grafts with host cartilage, the walls of the envisioned cup can direct cell migration directly to the graft-host cartilage interface via chemotactic agent delivery, where scaffold electroactivity will encourage cells to deposit a structurally contiguous neocartilage matrix. At the boundary between the graft and underlying bone, the scaffold cup base will mimic the topography and ceramic chemistry of the native osteochondral interface while preventing bone vasculature from growing upwards into the cartilage, guided by the hypothesis that this will enable the formation of a calcified cartilage interface layer that merges the graft and subchondral bone.To test these hypotheses, this thesis began with green electrospinning the scaffold cup walls incorporated with insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), a well-established chondrocyte chemoattractant that induced cell migration from cartilage autografts towards resulting fibers. Additionally, the walls contained an optimized dose of graphite nanoparticles to impart electroactivity to the fibers. Mimicking the fixed charge density of cartilage in this way promoted chondrocyte proliferation and biosynthesis of a hyaline cartilage-like matrix in vitro, with selective regulation of proteoglycans (biglycan and decorin) and downregulation of collagen type I compared to a graphite-free fiber control. Moreover, the graphite fibers sequestered IGF-1, sustaining release of the growth factor and improving functional graft-cartilage shear integration strength in vitro. In a full thickness defect osteochondral construct repaired with the scaffold cup and implanted subcutaneously in rat dorsi, localized IGF-1 delivery promoted graft-host cartilage interface matrix elaboration with significantly greater integration strength measured with graphite in the cup walls.For integration with subchondral bone, design criteria for the scaffold cup base were set by quantitatively mapping the compositional and morphometric characteristics of healthy and osteoarthritic human osteochondral tissues, and evaluating FEBio simulations of calcified cartilage and polymer-ceramic composite fibers in silico. These analyses established the need for an interdigitating mesh topography and ceramic particle incorporation, which minimize shear and distribute loading across the fibers, respectively, recapitulating the osteochondral interface’s force gradient from cartilage to bone in order to functionally integrate the tissues. Thus, the dose of calcium deficient apatite (CDA) nanoparticles, which capture the high calcium-phosphate ratio and semi-crystalline atomic structure of native bone mineral, was optimized to promote deep zone chondrocyte growth and biosynthesis of a calcified cartilage matrix in vitro. Moreover, CDA enhanced remodeling of the interface in vivo, with undulating fibers preventing osseous upgrowth.Taken together, these findings delineate the importance of strategic biomimicry in scaffold design, specifically with regards to interface regeneration and cartilage integration. The proposed approach is unique in that it utilized cell homing and an electroactive substrate to mimic properties of the cartilage matrix, with a strategy for simultaneous graft integration with host cartilage and bone. Moreover, the cup design is readily adaptable to current cartilage repair techniques including press-fit autografting and cell-based graft implantation, as well as emerging tissue engineered grafting strategies. Beyond cartilage repair, the scaffold design criteria established in this thesis are broadly applicable to integrating other complex tissue systems, and may inform the regeneration of critical soft-soft (muscle-tendon) and soft-hard (tendon- or ligament-bone) interfaces in the musculoskeletal system.

TI  - Caloric Restriction and Consequences in Metabolism
AU  - Marques, Miguel de Gouveia Quadrado Mora
A3  - Silva, Auxiliar Margarida Maria Fernandes Baptista
AB  - Caloric restriction (CR) may contribute for improving multiple metabolic processes, generating benefits throughout the whole organism. In this context, the potential delay of ageing progression and of development of age-related diseases has been widely studied. To explain the ageing process, the “mitochondrial theory of aging” is regarded as one of the most promising concept, which establishes a link between an impairment of mitochondria and consequent production and accumulation of ROS. Several studies suggest that improvements in mitochondrial function induced by CR are related with an increase in mitochondrial biogenesis and turnover.The present monograph summarizes the main biochemical mechanisms associated with CR and aims to review the major research reports concerning the respective consequences to mitochondrial metabolism. This review will focus on CR-dependent role on health promotion by modulating crucial pathways associated with mitochondrial biogenesis. These are controlled by AMPK, sirtuins, IGF-1, TOR and PGC-1α, leading to lower endogenous ROS production.However in recent years, some risks associated with CR and with implementation of long-term severe diets in humans have been defined. The search for safer and more practical alternative compounds, known as “CR mimetics”, has emerged. Metformin, rapamycin and resveratrol are examples among the most promising compounds, with potential for future therapeutic application. Therefore, the mechanisms underlying the physiological benefits of CR mimetics will also be reviewed in present work.Alternate abstract:A restrição calórica (RC) pode contribuir para melhorar múltiplos processos metabólicos, gerando benefícios em todo o organismo. Neste contexto, o potencial atraso na progressão do envelhecimento e no desenvolvimento de doenças relacionadas à idade têm sido amplamente estudados. Para explicar o processo de envelhecimento, a “teoria mitocondrial do envelhecimento” é considerada como um dos conceitos mais promissores, que estabelece uma relação estreita entre o comprometimento da mitocôndria e a consequente produção e acumulação de espécies reativas de oxigénio (ROS). Vários estudos sugerem que uma melhoria na função mitocondrial induzida por RC está relacionada com um aumento na biogénese e turnover mitocondrial.A presente monografia resume os principais mecanismos bioquímicos associados à RC e tem como objetivo principal rever os trabalhos científicos mais significativos sobre as inerentes consequências para o metabolismo mitocondrial. Esta revisão irá focar-se no papel da RC na promoção da saúde, modulando vias cruciais associadas à biogénese mitocondrial. Estes processos são controlados por AMPK, sirtuinas, IGF-1, TOR e PGC-1α, levando a uma menor produção endógena de ROS.No entanto, nos últimos anos, alguns riscos para o Homem associados à RC e à implementação de dietas drásticas a longo prazo, foram também estabelecidos. A pesquisa de compostos alternativos mais seguros e práticos, conhecidos como “miméticos de RC”, tem vindo a desenvolver-se. A metformina, rapamicina e resveratrol constituem exemplos entre os compostos mais promissores, com potencialidades para futura aplicação terapêutica. Por este motivo, os mecanismos subjacentes aos benefícios fisiológicos dos miméticos de RC também serão abordados no âmbito deste trabalho.

TI  - A Functional Genomics Approach to Elucidate the Role of Systemic Factors in Human Aging and Longevity
AU  - Tare, Archana
A3  - Suh, Yousin
AB  - The sharp increase of 5.5 years in global life expectancy between 2000 and 2016 due to advances in modern medicine has come at the cost of increased social and economic burden, since healthspan (healthy, disease-free lifespan) has not increased as much as lifespan. Advancing adult age is a major risk factor for mortality and chronic diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. Diverse approaches that aim at a reduction in the length and severity of late-life morbidity (also referred to as compression of morbidity) are required to cope with the increased toll of age-related disease due to the rapidly increasing older population. Geronic factors, circulating proteins and peptides in the blood discovered through heterochronic parabiosis and blood exchange studies, have been shown to either reverse/prevent (anti-geronic) multiple age-related pathologies in old animals or promote (pro-geronic) those age-related pathologies prematurely in young animals, and the therapeutic application of these factors represents one such approach to extend healthy lifespan. However, how the signaling pathways and interaction networks of these geronic factors play a role in human aging and longevity remains unknown. In this thesis work, I took an un-biased, human genetics approach to study the role of candidate genes involved in the known systemic geronic factor signaling pathways and interacting networks on human aging and longevity. My main hypothesis was that a cluster of genotypes enriched in anti-geronic and/or depleted in pro-geronic factor signaling gene regulatory networks promotes longevity in humans. My goal was to identify and characterize functional variants in the candidate genes associated with human longevity.
In Chapter 2, from a comprehensive literature and database search, I compiled a list of candidate genes including systemic factors, their signaling and interacting pathway genes, and investigated their role in human age-related diseases using in silico analysis of published genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data. Candidate genes showed a significant enrichment of age-related disease-associated variants as compared to the number- and gene length-matched control gene sets. I, along with Drs. Xiao Dong and Simon Johnson, developed a tool called EARDiG to evaluate the enrichment of candidate genes in human age-related diseases, using GWAS data and control gene sets. As a proof of principle, we assessed whether conserved pathways of aging are enriched in diseases of aging and showed enrichment of insulin/IGF-1/mTOR signaling pathway genes in neurodegenerative disease, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic disease categories.
In Chapter 3, I investigated the association of variants in two major candidate genes, GDF11, a multi-tissue anti-geronic factor, and its close homolog MSTN with  human longevity. I found that genetic variants in neither GDF11 nor MSTN showed significant association with longevity in Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) centenarian cohort. While, similar results were observed for both genes in an Italian centenarian cohort, GDF11, but not  MSTN, were found to be associated with longevity in long-lived individuals (LLI) from the Leiden Longevity study (LLS). GDF11 variants were significantly depleted in centenarians as compared to controls in the LLS, suggesting deleterious rather than beneficial effects of GDF11 variants in human longevity. Further studies are required to replicate these findings.
In Chapter 4, I performed a comprehensive target-capture and sequencing of 146 candidate genes involved in systemic geronic factor signaling in Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) centenarian and control populations and identified genes and variants associated with longevity. Furthermore, I annotated and prioritized  functional variants using genetic and epigenetic databases and investigated the functional role of longevity-associated variants  in SMAD3. I found that a functional variant in a rare longevity-associated haplotype in intron 1 of SMAD3 caused reduced expression of SMAD3 through allele-specific binding of transcription factor, ELK1, in human cell models. Furthermore, I showed that reduced expression of SMAD3 extended replicative lifespan of human primary cells, providing a pro-longevity effects of SMAD3 variant.
Taken together, by taking a multidisciplinary approach I investigated the role of systemic geronic factor gene regulatory networks in human longevity. I identified a new longevity-associated gene, SMAD3, and functionally characterized a rare non-coding haplotype within it to understand a mechanism underlying the association. Furthermore, I developed a method to evaluate the enrichment of candidate gene sets of interest in human age-related diseases and showed the relevance of a major conserved pathway of aging in human aging.

TI  - Efficacy of dhea to fight against ovarian ageing
AU  - Narkwichean, Amarin
AB  - There is an increase in the number of women with subfertility, who seek assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatment to overcome involuntary childlessness due to ovarian ageing, but which is commonly associated with poor response to ovarian stimulation protocols resulting in poor outcomes during ART. A few clinical studies have shown that DHEA, an androgen mainly secreted from the adrenal glands, can improve ovarian response and increase the chances of pregnancy after in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment in women affected by ovarian ageing. However, clinical evidence as well as knowledge regarding underlying mechanisms of DHEA on improving ovarian response is still limited. The research was divided into 2 arms; i) mechanistic experiments where sheep, a monoovulatory species with a long period of folliculogenesis, were used to investigate DHEA mechanisms and ii) a pilot randomised study called DITTO (DHEA intervention to treat ovarian ageing) to evaluate the efficacy of DHEA in clinical IVF practice. The first animal experiment (chapter 3) utilised an ovarian cortical ‘normograft’ model in which a single ovary (n=6) was taken out operatively. Half of the ovary was prepared for small pieces of ovarian cortical grafts and transferred back onto the cut- ovarian pedicle. The other half was fixed for use as a control. DHEA implants were administered to the animals and left for a 10-week period. The second operation was scheduled to harvest both the remaining ovary and cortical graft. The normograft procedure allows i) destruction of all growing follicular pool and synchronisation of primordial follicle initiation in the autograft without endocrinological disturbance, and ii) retention of the normal follicular hierarchy in the remaining ovary. DHEA stimulates primordial follicle initiation and preantral/early antral follicular development in the gonadotrophin responsive stages by improving granulosa cell proliferation and modulating local growth factors e.g. anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH). The second animal experiment (Chapter 4) was conducted partly to confirm the effects observed in the first experiment by comparing with the control animals. The animal number was double (12 mature ewes) and they were divided into two groups; animals treated with DHEA implants for 12 weeks and controls with placebo treatment. Moreover, the experiment was designed to compare, between treatment and control, ovarian response to controlled ovarian stimulation mimicking the human IVF cycle. The findings confirm that DHEA treatment increases the rate of follicle initiation as well as stimulating preantral follicular growth. Enhancing granulosa cell proliferation is one of the mechanisms but DHEA treatment also increases follicular response to both FSH and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) by positive modulation of receptors expression. Higher follicular P4 production was observed in treated animals after the gonadotrophin stimulation when compared to the controls. A pilot double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomised trial was performed over two years with 60 women undergoing IVF. Subjects were randomised to receive either 75 mg/day DHEA or a placebo for at least 12 weeks with both capsules having similar colour, size and appearance. Sixty women were recruited with poor ovarian reserve based on antral follicle count or anti-Mullerian hormone thresholds. Subsequently, all patients were scheduled to the long gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist IVF protocol with hMG, starting dose at 300 IU/day. Ovarian response, live birth rates and molecular markers of oocyte quality were compared between the study and control groups on the ‘intention to treat’ basis. Unfortunately, the clinical trial could not demonstrate a significant improvement in terms of pregnancy outcomes and ovarian response markers in the treatment group when compared to the control. The numbers of oocytes obtained from the egg collection procedure were similar between the two groups. Also, there was no significant difference in all cumulus and granulosa mRNA expressions concerning oocyte developmental competence. In conclusion, there is currently no established clinical evidence supporting the use of DHEA as an adjuvant in IVF treatment. In contrast, in vivo animal studies demonstrate that DHEA treatment potentially provides stimulatory effects on folliculogenesis, thus indicating the importanceof androgens at all stages of follicular development. Further investigations are required to confirm these potential findings. If the beneficial effects of DHEA are confirmed, it can provide a safe and less costly intervention to fight against ovarian ageing in terms of infertility treatment and menopausal conditions.

TI  - Mechanisms and Consequences of Microglial Priming and Dysregulated M2a Responses with Age and Central Nervous System Injury
AU  - Fenn, Ashley Margaret
A3  - Godbout, Jonathan
AB  - Aging is associated with the development of primed and hyper-reactive microglial population within the central nervous system (CNS). After an immune challenge these primed microglia release exaggerated levels of inflammatory cytokines into the CNS resulting in the development of neuropsychological complications including cognitive decline and depression. How and why these primed microglia develop in the aged brain is unclear, but recent studies indicate that microglia in the aged brain have reduced exposure and are more resistant to anti-inflammatory regulation. Rather than impairment in a single regulatory pathway, the aged brain demonstrates a loss in almost every regulatory system investigated including neuronal regulation by CD200 and fractalkine (CX3CL1), anti-inflammatory regulation by interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-4, and global regulation by micro-RNAs (miRs). Of these regulatory pathways, research into mechanisms for reduced CX3CL1 expression, reduced responsiveness to IL-4, and aberrant miR expression in the aged brain is lacking. Moreover, research into the degree to which the development of this primed microglia phenotype can be accelerated by CNS trauma or the degree to which primed microglia contribute to neuropsychiatric complications experienced by persons with traumatic brain injury (TBI) has not been performed. To address these holes in our understanding of microglia regulation and priming in the aged and injured CNS four primary studies were performed.      In the first study, miRs associated with the immune response were measured in adult and aged mouse and human brain, and mouse microglia. In both mouse and human samples miR-29a/b-1 was significantly increased with age associated with   reduced expression of CX3CL1 and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, two confirmed targets of miR-29a/b-1 that negatively regulate microglia activation. Thus, age-associated increases in miR-29a/b-1 could contribute to reduced microglial regulation and the development of a primed microglia phenotype (Chapter 2).     Following the development of a primed phenotype, these microglia may be more resistant to regulation by anti-inflammatory factors including IL-4. In the second study, upregulation of the receptor for IL-4, IL-4 receptor (IL-4R)a, was reduced in microglia of aged mice corresponding to reduced responsiveness to IL-4 and a failure to induce an arginase+/iNOSlo anti-inflammatory phenotype (Chapter 3). Because an IL-4-induced arginase phenotype is implicated in improved repair and recovery after a traumatic CNS injury (e.g., spinal cord injury (SCI)), the ability of microglia from aged mice to develop an IL-4-directed M2a phenotype after SCI was evaluated in the third study. Corresponding to our immune challenge studies, microglia from aged mice had reduced expression of IL-4Ra after SCI compared to microglia from adult mice and this was associated with increased pathology and worsened functional recovery (Chapter 4). Intriguingly, reduced IL-4-signaling in the aged was associated with an attenuated inflammatory response and reduced recruitment of peripheral macrophages to the CNS after SCI or peripheral LPS challenge (Chapter 4).     Finally, evidence of activation markers associated with microglia priming (e.g., major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II) has been observed in animal modes of TBI and in TBI patients suggesting that microglia priming can be accelerated by a traumatic CNS injury. Thus, the degree to which TBI-primed microglia are hyper-reactive to an inflammatory challenge promote neuropsychiatric complications after TBI was investigated in the fourth study. One month after TBI microglial MHC II expression was increased corroborating previous studies. Moreover, these primed microglia were hyper-reactive to an inflammatory challenge inducing prolonged sickness behavior and the development of depressive-like behavior in TBI mice. These studies indicate that age-associated microglia priming can be accelerated by TBI and is likely responsible for increased TBI-associated cognitive impairment and depression (Chapter 5).     Taken together, these studies uncovered a mechanism for reduced CX 3CL1 and IGF-1 in the aged brain corresponding with increased microglial priming, identified a deficit in IL-4Ra expression by aged microglia resulting in reduced responsiveness to IL-4 and increased morbidity after SCI, and demonstrated that microglial priming is accelerated by a TBI leading to increased sensitivity to secondary challenges (e.g., stress, infection, second injury) and precipitation of neuropsychiatric complications including cognitive decline and depression. Collectively these studies provide novel insight into the mechanisms of microglial priming and regulation with age and injury.

TI  - Lifespan mechanisms: A role for mitochondrial homeostasis controlled by insulin like signaling
AU  - Lerner, Chad Ashyr
A3  - Sell, Christian
AB  - The aging process involves a trade-off between growth and reproduction on the one hand and maintenance and repair on the other. In times of plenty, organisms must take advantage of the availability of nutrients for growth and reproduction. However, the utilization of resources for anabolic needs occurs at the expense of maintenance processes necessary to maintain homeostasis. When nutrients are scant, cells switch from growth to stress resistance and repair. In eukaryotes, the Target of Rapamycin (TOR) has a central role in controlling this switch. TOR is responsive to nutrient availability as well as growth factor signaling. IGF-1 and Insulin-like signaling, stimulates TOR kinase activity to regulate protein translation and cell growth. Reduced TOR activity or IGF-1 signaling are features of several models of increased longevity. Our mice are hypomorphic for the IGF-1 allele. These mice are smaller in size and exhibit increased lifespan. The precise mechanism by which reduced Insulin-like signaling affects the state of the cell and supports an increased lifespan is not well understood. Using IGF-1 deficient mice and primary human fibroblasts, we have observed that reduced IGF-1 or impairment of mTOR activity with rapamycin slows growth and enhances autophagy. Under conditions of reduced TOR activity by rapamycin, mitochondrial function is improved along with an increase in mitochondrial mass and mitochondrial gene expression. Furthermore, the expression and turnover of the adaptor protein p62/SQSTM1 appears to be required for the stability and expression of Nrf2(NEF2L) and Tfam, two factors important for mitochondrial homeostasis. Rapamycin treated cells are also resistant to oxidative stress, likely due to increased Nrf2 activity and do not accumulate mitochondria with impaired membrane potential, an effect which is dependent on autophagy. These results suggest that reduced signaling through TOR benefits mitochondrial function and homeostasis, and reveals a new role for p62 as a factor in the mammalian retrograde response.

TI  - Revealing the plastic brain with functional connectivity: Effects of exercise on brain plasticity and cognition
AU  - Voss, Michelle Webb
A3  - Kramer, Arthur F.
AB  - Research supporting a greater understanding of the biological basis of cognitive aging and dementia, and important factors for their prevention, is essential for the development of low-cost prevention and treatment programs to address the aging crisis. For instance, although age is a prominent risk factor for AD, epidemiological studies have shown that lifestyle factors such as physical exercise significantly decrease age-related risks for cognitive impairment and AD. Yet relatively little is known about precisely how exercise effects on the brain benefit human cognition.    In this thesis I examine effects of physical activity on age-related deficits in brain function and cognition, followed by an examination of potential explanatory neurobiological factors. I examine brain function by assessing patterns of functional brain organization, or brain networks, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Using fMRI I demonstrate the use of multiple methods for measuring functional coherence of brain networks, and in turn, illustrate what various methods reveal about the positive effects of exercise on the aging brain. In the final study, I examine potential moderators and mediators for the positive effects of exercise on the brain, such as neurobiological markers of brain plasticity.    Normal aging is associated with a decline in cognitive functions, such as processing speed, episodic memory, and executive-control skills such as inhibition, planning, and working memory, and relative stability in semantic knowledge. Brain imaging studies have also revealed that the aging brain is characterized by increased variability in brain activation patterns which are often hard to explain by unified theories of cognitive aging. In turn researchers have started to characterize functional brain networks comprised of regionally separate but temporally connected brain regions, which could help uncover fundamental patterns of systems-level change associated with cognitive aging. One functional brain network, the default mode network (DMN), has received much attention for its capacity to predict individual differences in normal age-related cognitive decline and clinical pathologies such as AD and MCI.    Since both default mode network (DMN) function and increased aerobic fitness have been associated with improved cognitive performance and reduced incidence of AD among older adults. The first study in my dissertation investigated this link by examining the association between aerobic fitness, DMN function, and cognitive performance.   The second study in my dissertation extends the first study by (1) examining change in functional connectivity after a year-long randomized controlled trial of exercise training with elderly adults, and (2) comparing the effects of exercise on multiple brain networks including the DMN, two additional cognitively relevant brain networks, and primary motor and auditory sensory networks.    In the third study I introduced another a class of methods for measuring functional connectivity in the brain, based on mathematical models that have been used for characterizing dynamic network behavior in self-organizing real-world systems, such as social networks or patterns of commercial airplane travel. Such methods provide a way to quantitatively describe the integration and segregation of communication patterns in the brain, and compare them to theoretical models of network communication, such as “small world” network models. In this study I first use graph metrics to describe the associations between network topology, aging, and aerobic fitness in elderly adults and voxel-wise network metrics of communication in the brain. Second, I examine how exercise training affects such metrics of brain communication.   Finally, the fourth study examined the association between measures of brain connectivity and potential explanatory factors of the benefits of exercise on brain function, including neurobiological markers of brain plasticity measured from peripheral blood serum. Brain neurotrophins such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are considered primary molecular factors mediating effects of exercise on the aging brain, so the aim of this study was to link training-induced changes in BDNF, IGF-1, and VEGF with training-induced changes in functional brain connectivity as measured through univariate methods (Chapters 1 and 2) and multivariate methods (Chapter 3). However, since there were no changes in regional connectivity patterns in favor of the walking group, this study only examined the association between changes in connectivity shown in Chapter 2, and changes in neurobiological factors. The study also examined the extent to which baseline measures of peripheral growth factors was associated with change in functional connectivity in regional connections sensitive to exercise training.

TI  - Roles of SIRT1 in neuronal oxidative damage and brain function
AU  - Li, Ying
A3  - Longo, Valter
AB  - Aging is a common phenomenon of multiple organisms. In humans aging is frequently accompanied by cognitive decline and occurrence of neurodegenerative diseases which reduce the quality of life and impose financial stress on society. Delaying the aging process, extending life span and decreasing the occurrence of age-related brain function deficit have always been aspirations of human kind. Extensive research has advanced our understanding of the mechanisms underlying aging, among which is the ability of calorie restriction to increase longevity, and the pivotal regulatory roles of insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway. Some recent studies identified silent information regulator 2 (Sir2; SIRT1 is the mammalian homolog) as a key mediator of the beneficial effects of calorie restriction and this prompted development of SIRT1 activators for human consumption to delay aging and accompanying cognitive decline. However, our laboratory previously showed in yeast that Sir2 can increase stress sensitivity and limit life span extension under certain conditions, calling for more detailed characterization of SIRT1. In the research described in this dissertation I extended this study to the mammalian system and focused on the role of SIRT1 on the health of neurons and brain functions, especially learning and memory.    This dissertation consists of three chapters. In chapter 1 I briefly review some recent progress on aging, oxidative stress, insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway and learning and memory with emphasis on the involvement of SIRT1 in these processes. In chapter 2 I focused on the role of SIRT1 in oxidative stress in neurons and its mechanisms. I found that SIRT1 inhibition increased resistance to oxidative damage and this effect is partially mediated by a reduction in IGF-I/IRS-2/Ras/ERK1/2 signaling. In chapter 3 I studied the functions of SIRT1 in learning and memory. The experiments showed that deletion of SIRT1 impairs a certain form of synaptic plasticity and reduce performance in several different learning and memory tasks while overexpressing SIRT1 did not substantially affect learning and memory.    Together, my studies reveal that SIRT1 exacerbates neuronal oxidative damage but is essential in learning and memory, indicating that SIRT1 plays multiple roles in aging and brain functions and that caution should be exercised in designing anti-aging or therapeutic approaches that involve targeting SIRT1.

T2  - Advances in genetics
AB  - Aging can be defined as the progressive decline in tissue and organismal function and the ability to respond to stress that occurs in association with homeostatic  failure and the accumulation of molecular damage. Aging is the biggest risk  factor for human disease and results in a wide range of aging pathologies.  Although we do not completely understand the underlying molecular basis that  drives the aging process, we have gained exceptional insights into the plasticity  of life span and healthspan from the use of model organisms such as the worm  Caenorhabditis elegans and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Single-gene  mutations in key cellular pathways that regulate environmental sensing, and the  response to stress, have been identified that prolong life span across evolution  from yeast to mammals. These genetic manipulations also correlate with a delay in  the onset of tissue and organismal dysfunction. While the molecular genetics of  aging will remain a prosperous and attractive area of research in biogerontology,  we are moving towards an era defined by the search for therapeutic drugs that  promote healthy aging. Translational biogerontology will require incorporation of  both therapeutic and pharmacological concepts. The use of model organisms will  remain central to the quest for drug discovery, but as we uncover molecular  processes regulated by repurposed drugs and polypharmacy, studies of  pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics, drug-drug interactions, drug toxicity, and  therapeutic index will slowly become more prevalent in aging research. As we move  from genetics to pharmacology and therapeutics, studies will not only require  demonstration of life span extension and an underlying molecular mechanism, but  also the translational relevance for human health and disease prevention.

AB  - Evidence is accumulating that aging is hormonally regulated by an evolutionarily conserved insulin/IGF-1 signalling (IIS) pathway. Mutations in IIS components  affect lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster and mice. Most  long-lived IIS mutants also show increased resistance to oxidative stress. In D.  melanogaster and mice, the long-lived phenotype of several IIS mutants is  restricted to females. Here, we analysed the relationship between IIS signalling,  body height and longevity in humans in a prospective follow-up study. Based on  the expected effects (increased or decreased signalling) of the selected variants  in IIS pathway components (GHRHR, GH1, IGF1, INS, IRS1), we calculated composite  IIS scores to estimate IIS pathway activity. In addition, we analysed the  relative impact on lifespan and body size of the separate variants in  multivariate models. In women, lower IIS scores are significantly associated with  lower body height and improved old age survival. Multivariate analyses showed  that these results were most pronounced for the GH1 SNP, IGF1 CA repeat and IRS1  SNP. In females, for variant allele carriers of the GH1 SNP, body height was 2 cm  lower (P = 0.007) and mortality 0.80-fold reduced (P = 0.019) when compared with  wild-type allele carriers. Thus, in females, genetic variation causing reduced  IIS activation is beneficial for old age survival. This effect was stronger for  the GH1 SNP than for variation in the conserved IIS genes that were found to  affect longevity in model organisms.

AB  - During the last three centuries the expected lifespan in civilized countries has increased several times. The fastest growing groups are seniors (65+) and  centenarians. Increased lifespan results in postponing of aging and age-related  diseases. On the other hand, an increase in the number of people suffering from  age-related diseases can be observed. Studies concerning longevity and aging help  to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for these processes and give hope for  finding the recipe for a healthy and long lifespan. Aging and longevity are  modulated by genetic, epigenetic and stochastic factors. Already some variants of  genes which correlate with longevity are known. Products of these genes are  involved in lipid metabolism and in nutrient sensing signaling pathways such as:  insulin/IGF-1 and TOR. Good indicators for human polymorphism study are results  obtained using model organisms such as S. cerevisiae, C. elegans, D. melanogaster  and laboratory mice. Aging and longevity are evolutionary conserved. Evolutionary  theories concerning aging can be divided into two general categories: programmed  and non-programmed ones. According to programmed theories aging is adaptive and  can lead to altruistic death of kins. Non-programmed theories predict that  organisms only have a limited amount of energy that has to be divided between  reproductive activities and the maintenance of the non-reproductive aspects of  the organism. Aging is the effect of natural degrading processes that result in  the accumulation of damage. Accumulation of damaged DNA and proteins can lead to  cellular senescence, inflammaging and age-related diseases. Strategies for  postponing aging mainly rely on protecting and/or eliminating these lesions.

AB  - Aging is due to a complex interaction of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors, but a strong genetic component appears to have an impact on survival to  extreme ages. In order to identify "longevity genes" in humans, different  strategies are now available. In our laboratory, we performed association studies  on a variety of "candidate" polymorphisms in Italian centenarians. Many  genes/polymorphisms gave negative results, while others showed a positive  association with human longevity and a sometimes-positive association with  unsuccessful aging (myocardial infarction, Alzheimer's disease, and type 2  diabetes). Results regarding genes involved in inflammation (IL-1 cluster, IL-6,  IL-10, TNF-alpha, TGF-beta, TLR-4, PPARgamma), insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway  and lipid metabolism (apolipoproteins, CETP, PON1), and oxidative stress (p53,  p66(shc)) will be described. In addition, a strong role of the interaction  between nuclear and mitochondrial genomes (mtDNA haplogroups and the C150T  mutation) emerged from our findings. Thus, the genetics of human longevity  appears to be quite peculiar in a context where antagonistic pleiotropy can play  a major role and genes can have a different biological role at different ages.

AB  - Genetic manipulations and dietary restriction in model organisms have proven that lifespan extension is achievable. Moreover these same interventions can protect against age-related diseases and improve general healthiness. Therefore, current efforts are being put forward to identify drugs that mimic healthy lifespan. Lithium has been documented to be able to extend the lifespan of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, reduce mortality in Drosophila and a recent report has suggested that lithium concentrations in drinking water correlate with reduced mortality for all causes in a human population. The main objective of the project presented here was to determine the anti-ageing properties of lithium using the fruit fly and to determine the mechanism by which lithium exerts its broad health benefits and anti-ageing properties. My results showed that lithium extended lifespan independent of sex and genetic background. Lithium treated flies were also resistant to multiple stressors and showed reduced triglyceride levels. Lithium did not modify fecundity and it further extended lifespan of DR flies. The pro-longevity effects seemed to also be independent of the nutrient sensing network as it could further extend lifespan of flies with reduced signalling though the insulin/IGF-1 and the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) network. I performed transcriptional and translational microarrays in lithium treated flies and found out that lithium up-regulated a transcriptional response to stress regulated by the transcription factor cap’n’collar/NRF-2 and down-regulated functional categories implicated in mitochondrial complex I. By performing epistasis experiments I found out that lithium and shaggy, the fly homologue of GSK-3, regulate ageing by acting in the same molecular pathway. However, shaggy seemed to modulate ageing in a tissue-specific manner. The combination of lithium and genetic manipulations of shaggy revealed a very complex regulation of ageing and neurodegeneration. I also explored the nature of neurodegeneration induced by over-expression of Aβ1-42 and found out that some of the changes induced by Aβ1-42 impact general physiology and not only neurons. For example, our results suggest that altered metabolism is a prominent feature of the toxicity of Aβ1-42 in Drosophila.

TI  - MicroRNA Function During Aging in Caenorhabditis elegans and Humans
AU  - Smith-Vikos, Thalyana Marie

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short, non-coding RNAs that bind mRNAs through partial base-pair complementarity with their target genes, resulting in post-transcriptional repression of gene expression. miRNAs control aging-related functions such as metabolism and lifespan through regulation of genes in insulin signaling, mitochondrial respiration and protein homeostasis.    I have developed a network analysis of aging-associated miRNAs connected to transcription factors PHA-4/FOXA and SKN-1/Nrf, which are both necessary for dietary restriction (DR)-induced lifespan extension in the nematode  Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). The network analysis has revealed extensive regulatory interactions between PHA-4, SKN-1 and miRNAs and points to two aging-associated miRNAs, miR-71 and miR-228, as key nodes of this network. I have shown that miR-71 and miR-228 are critical for the response to dietary restriction in C. elegans. Dietary restriction induces the expression of miR-71 and miR-228, and the regulation of these miRNAs depends on PHA-4 and SKN-1. In turn, I have shown that PHA-4 and SKN-1 are negatively regulated by miR-228, while miR-71 represses PHA-4. This network fine-tunes the DR-response in C. elegans to promote longevity.   I have also studied early-life differences in organismal robustness in individual C. elegans and examined the utility of miRNAs as aging biomarkers. I quantitatively examined C. elegans reared individually in a novel apparatus and observed throughout their lives. I identified three miRNAs in which early-adulthood expression patterns individually predict up to 47% of lifespan differences. Though expression of each increases throughout this time, mir-71 and mir-246 correlate with lifespan, while mir-239 anti-correlates. Two of these three miRNA "biomarkers of aging" act upstream in insulin/IGF-1–like signaling (IIS) and other known longevity pathways; thus, I have inferred that these miRNAs not only report on but also likely determine longevity.    As miRNAs and aging genetic pathways are conserved from nematodes to humans, it may also be that miRNAs function as aging biomarkers in a similar manner in humans. To test this hypothesis, I measured miRNA levels from human blood samples taken at ages 50, 55, and 60 from individuals with documented lifespans. In particular, there is a significant and reproducible correlation between lifespans of the 16 individuals in the pilot study and expression levels of six miRNAs in the serum samples. I concluded that the expression profiles of these six miRNAs may be useful biomarkers for aging. Bioinformatics predictions and network analyses indicate numerous aging-associated functions of possible targets of these miRNAs.   In this thesis, I present my findings on these topics, and I discuss future approaches that can be used to investigate the mechanisms by which miRNAs govern aging processes.

AB  - The metafor package provides functions for conducting meta-analyses in R. The package includes functions for ﬁtting the meta-analytic ﬁxed- and random-eﬀects models and allows for the inclusion of moderators variables (study-level covariates) in these models. Meta-regression analyses with continuous and categorical moderators can be conducted in this way. Functions for the Mantel-Haenszel and Peto’s one-step method for metaanalyses of 2 × 2 table data are also available. Finally, the package provides various plot functions (for example, for forest, funnel, and radial plots) and functions for assessing the model ﬁt, for obtaining case diagnostics, and for tests of publication bias.
